## Answers and Analysis

### Question 1: Marriage and Matrimonial Agreements

- **Answer**: Yes, Alison and Billy's matrimonial agreement is valid considering it was signed before a notary and witnesses the day after their impulsive wedding. In Louisiana, matrimonial agreements must be entered into before the marriage or acknowledged before a notary in the presence of two witnesses to be valid.

- **Supporting Information**: Louisiana Civil Code Articles regarding matrimonial regimes and agreements provide that spouses may agree to exclude or alter the legal regime of community property through a matrimonial agreement. This must be executed with certain formalities.

### Question 2: Property and Servitudes

- **Answer**: The incident involves a potential acquisitive prescription and issues related to servitudes. Peter's fence encroachment could lead to him acquiring the land via acquisitive prescription if he possesses it as if he were the owner for ten years (under good faith and just title). As for servitudes, Alex granted Peter use of a servitude path without formal agreement, which complicates the access rights.

- **Supporting Information**: According to the Louisiana Civil Code, servitudes can be established for the benefit of a property (predial servitude), and ownership can be acquired through acquisitive prescription under certain conditions. The encroachment may lead to a legal dispute on both grounds.
