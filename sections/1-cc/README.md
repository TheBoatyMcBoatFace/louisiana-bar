# Civil Code I
This section covers key aspects of Louisiana's Civil Code, including obligations, property law, matrimonial regimes, and more. It's designed to test candidates' understanding of Louisiana's unique legal principles, largely derived from French civil law.

## Flash Facts
Candidates need to be familiar with the principles of Louisiana's community property regime, matrimonial agreements, paternity laws, the classification of property (separate vs. community), and the rights and obligations arising from marriage, including those related to spousal support and the management of property. Understanding the legal implications of actions taken during marriage and the effects of agreements made before or during the marriage is crucial.


### Case Questions

#### Case 1: Marriage and Matrimonial Agreements
Billy and Alison hastily marry without understanding the implications of their relationship’s past or their future, especially concerning matrimonial agreements about community property and spousal support.

**FULL TEXT**
> After dating for several years, Alison and Billy decided to take a break from dating. In December 2016, during this break, Alison had sexual relations with her old boyfriend Chris, which led to her becoming pregnant with Chris’s child. Almost immediately after having sex with Chris, Alison realized that she wanted to be with Billy, and they started dating again. Alison never told Billy about her relationship with Chris during the breakup.

> In January 2017, one week after Alison and Billy got back together, on a night when Billy was heavily drinking, Alison and Billy decided to get married on the spur of the moment. They visited a friend who was a validly licensed minister, who performed the marriage ceremony with a few friends serving as witnesses. When he woke up the next day, Billy did not remember getting married even after Alison and their friends told him about it. Nonetheless, he was still happy with the decision, and Alison and Billy began living together as husband and wife.

Soon after the wedding ceremony, Billy presented Alison with two proposed agreements: one that provided that, in the event of a divorce, each spouse fully and irrevocably waived any and all rights to both interim and final periodic support; and one that provided that each spouse opted out of the community property regime. Billy and Alison then signed both agreements before a notary and two witnesses.

> In September 2017, approximately eight months after the wedding ceremony, Alison gave
birth to a son, Sam. She had still not told Billy about her relationship with Chris, and Billy raised
Sam as his own child. However, Alison secretly conducted a paternity test using Billy’s hair
sample without his knowledge; the test confirmed that Billy was not Sam’s father.

> In 2018, Alison inherited $100,000 from her aunt. Because Billy was unemployed at the
time, she put this inheritance into a joint banking account with Billy. This account held all of their
funds, including her paychecks, his unemployment checks, and then his paychecks when he later
found a new job. They used the funds in this bank account for their general living expenses.

> In 2019, Alison and Billy had a daughter, Darla. Billy is Darla’s biological father.

> In September 2022, five years after Sam was born, Billy was looking through paperwork
on Alison’s desk, where he found the paternity test results. Billy confronted Alison about it, and
she confessed that she had had sex with Chris right before the marriage ceremony and that Sam
was Chris’s child.

> Billy was upset and distraught by this news, but nonetheless stayed in the family home.
One night in March 2023, he went out drinking and met Gretchen at a bar. Thinking that Alison
was staying over with Sam and Darla at her mother’s house, Billy brought Gretchen home. When
Alison returned home unexpectedly, she saw Billy and Gretchen engaged in sexual relations.

> Alison and Billy spent the next three weeks discussing their relationship and engaged in
sexual relations on a couple of occasions. After those three weeks, Alison and Billy both decided
that they could not remain married with such significant trust issues. In April 2023, Billy moved
out of the house. He and Alison have been living separate and apart since then. As of today, there
is $50,000 in their joint checking account.

**Questions**
1) Are Alison and Billy legally married? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question examines the validity of a marriage that occurred under potentially invalid circumstances (one party being intoxicated) and the subsequent acceptance and ratification of the marriage by living together as husband and wife.


**Answer**
Yes, Alison and Billy are legally married. In Louisiana, a marriage is considered valid if it is entered into freely by both parties. Although Billy was intoxicated at the time of the marriage, his subsequent acceptance of the marriage, evidenced by living together as husband and wife and not contesting the marriage, ratifies the marriage under Louisiana law.

2) What are each spouse’s options for divorce? What potential time delays, benefits and complications are associated with each option? Explain. (10 points)

    **Tips & Analysis**
    This question seeks to explore the legal grounds for divorce, focusing on fault-based and no-fault divorce options in Louisiana, and the implications of prenuptial agreements.


    **Answer**
    In Louisiana, spouses have the option for a no-fault divorce after living separate and apart for a legally specified period, or a fault-based divorce immediately under certain conditions. Given the prenuptial agreements and the circumstances (infidelity, substance abuse), both parties might consider a fault-based divorce for immediate separation. However, the prenuptial agreements may complicate claims for spousal support or property division.


---


3) Did Billy and Alison validly waive their right to interim and/or final spousal support through the agreements? Explain. (5 points)

    **Tips & Analysis**
    This question assesses the enforceability of prenuptial agreements concerning spousal support under Louisiana law.

    **Answer**
    Yes, if the prenuptial agreements were made in compliance with Louisiana law—signed freely, with full disclosure, and notarized—they can validly waive rights to interim and final spousal support. The court will enforce such waivers unless they result in an unconscionable outcome at the time of divorce.



---

4) Assume solely for this Question 1.4 that neither Alison nor Billy signed any agreement relating to interim or final spousal support. If Billy seeks both types of support from Alison, is there any other basis for Alison to challenge an award of interim and/or final spousal support in favor of Billy other than lack of need? Explain. (4 points)

    **Tips & Analysis**
    This question explores the factors courts consider in awarding spousal support absent a prenuptial agreement.

    **Answer**
    Beyond lack of need, Alison could challenge spousal support on the grounds of Billy's fault in the breakdown of the marriage (e.g., infidelity, substance abuse) if such behavior is recognized under Louisiana law as a factor in denying support.


---

5) Have Alison and Billy validly opted out of Louisiana’s community property regime? Explain. (5 points)


    **Tips & Analysis**
    This explores the effectiveness and legal standing of prenuptial agreements concerning the community property regime.

    **Answer**
    Yes, provided the agreement to opt-out of the community property regime was made in accordance with Louisiana law—meaning it was signed voluntarily, with full disclosure, and properly notarized—they have validly opted out. This affects the division of property upon divorce, with each party retaining what they brought into the marriage and what was acquired individually thereafter.


---

6) Assume solely for this Question 1.6 that Alison and Billy did not opt out of the community property regime. Is any portion of the $50,000 in the joint checking account Alison’s separate property? Explain. (8 points)


    **Tips & Analysis**
    This question examines the classification of funds in a joint checking account under the community property regime.

    **Answer**
    Without opting out, the funds in the joint checking account, including the $100,000 inheritance mixed with marital funds, would typically be considered community property. However, if Alison can trace her inheritance as the source of some funds, she may argue for those to be recognized as her separate property.

---

7) Assume solely for this Question 1.7 that earlier today (in July 2023) Billy filed an action to disavow paternity of Sam. Is that action timely? Explain. (3 points)

    **Tips & Analysis**
    This question addresses the timeliness and legal requirements for filing an action to disavow paternity in Louisiana.

    **Answer**
    In Louisiana, an action to disavow paternity must be filed within a specific time frame from when the husband learns or should have learned of the birth of the child or the facts establishing the lack of paternity. Given that Billy discovered the paternity test results in September 2022, filing an action in July 2023 may be considered timely, depending on the specific statutory period in effect.



#### Case 2:

**FULL TEXT**
By a valid act of sale 40 years ago, Alex acquired 40 acres of land in a square shape as his separate property. Alex’s property was bounded by a non-navigable river to the north, a paved public highway road to the south, his neighbor Wendy to the west and his neighbor Eve to the east. In the middle of Alex’s property, there was a paved road that ran from the public highway to the river; Alex used this paved road to access his property.

Five years after Alex acquired the property, he sold the 10-acre northeastern square portion of the property abutting the river and Eve’s property to his friend Peter. A week later, Peter put up a fence around his portion of the property. Although this fence was placed along the boundary between Peter’s 10 acres and Alex’s remaining 30 acres, Peter inadvertently placed the eastern portion of the fence on Eve’s property so that the ten feet of the westernmost portion of Eve’s property that abutted Peter’s property was enclosed within Peter’s fence. Peter used the paved road (which was immediately west of his fence separating his and Alex’s property) to access his
property from the public highway. Peter never discussed this with Alex, although Alex knew that he was using the paved road.

Ten years after Alex acquired the property, he also leased one acre on the northwesternmost
side of the property to his fishing buddy Fred for $1,000 per year pursuant to a written lease, which
expressly allowed Fred to build a fishing camp on the leased property and to use an old dirt road
that ran from this leased property southerly to the public road and also expressly provided that the
lease was freely assignable. On the leased property, Fred built a fishing camp on a concrete slab,
with four walls, a roof, as well as plumbing and electricity (which were connected with Alex’s
permission).
Although the lease agreement allowed Fred to use this old dirt road, Fred wanted to have
access to the paved road since it would place less wear and tear on his boat. The paved road was
connected to the fishing camp by a gravel road that led west along the river. Through a duly
acknowledged written agreement, Alex granted the right to access and use the paved and gravel
roads for fifty (50) years “for the benefit of my friend and fishing buddy Fred for smoother access
to the fishing camp.” Both this access agreement and the lease agreement were properly recorded
in the parish conveyance records promptly after they were signed, and Fred continually used the
paved and gravel roads to access his fishing camp up to his death 15 years ago.
About 20 years ago, Peter sold his property to Donna “together with all rights of
prescription, whether acquisitive or liberative, to which said vendor may be entitled,” but it did
not specifically reference the 10-foot strip of land enclosed by Peter’s fence. Donna has remained
the owner of this property ever since and also used the paved roadway. Recently, Alex and Donna
had an argument after which Alex told her that she could no longer use the paved road to access
her property.

As noted above, Fred died about 15 years ago. In his last will, he validly left everything in
his estate (including all his rights and interests in the fishing camp, the lease and the access
agreement) to his granddaughter Jenny. Although Jenny continued to pay the $1,000 rent per year
for the fishing camp lease in order to store her grandfather’s belongings, she did not like to fish
and did not like the outdoors in general. Thus, since Fred died, neither she nor anyone else has
visited the fishing camp or the leased property, except for an initial visit upon Fred’s death. Her
only other use of the paved road since Fred’s death was once to turn around on the public highway
about 7 years ago when she got lost in the area (although she did not visit the fishing camp at that
time).
When Jenny showed up at the property to remove her grandfather’s belongings from the
fishing camp last month, Alex told her that she could not use the paved and gravel roads to access
the fishing camp and instead should use the old dirt road to access the fishing camp.


**Answer**
Yes, Donna has the right to continue using the paved road to access the public road. This right is based on the principle of servitude of passage, which is necessary for the use of an enclosed estate. Since Donna's property, acquired from Peter, historically accessed the public road via the paved road on Alex's property, and considering the absence of any agreement to rescind this access when Donna bought the property, it can be implied that Donna has inherited this servitude with the property purchase. Additionally, there is a principle in civil law that servitudes remain attached to the estate and are transferred with the estate unless explicitly abolished. Therefore, the use of the paved road by Donna, as a successor to Peter, is a continuation of the servitude of passage.

As for compensation, generally, a servitude of passage may require initial compensation for establishing the servitude, but ongoing usage typically does not require further compensation unless such agreements were stipulated at the onset of the servitude's establishment. Since there is no mention of Donna (or her predecessor Peter) having to compensate Alex for the use of the road, and given that Alex was aware of and did not previously object to its use by Peter and subsequently Donna, it suggests that no additional compensation is required for Donna to continue using the paved road. However, should Alex seek to enforce changes or demand compensation, he would likely need to initiate legal proceedings, during which a court would consider the historical use, the original conditions under which the servitude was granted, and any potential harm or inconvenience caused to Alex’s property by Donna’s continued use of the road.
