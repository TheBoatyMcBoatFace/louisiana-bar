# Civil Code I
This section covers key aspects of Louisiana's Civil Code, including obligations, property law, matrimonial regimes, and more. It's designed to test candidates' understanding of Louisiana's unique legal principles, largely derived from French civil law.

## Flash Facts
Candidates need to be familiar with the principles of Louisiana's community property regime, matrimonial agreements, paternity laws, the classification of property (separate vs. community), and the rights and obligations arising from marriage, including those related to spousal support and the management of property. Understanding the legal implications of actions taken during marriage and the effects of agreements made before or during the marriage is crucial.


### Case Questions

#### Case 1: Marriage and Matrimonial Agreements
Billy and Alison hastily marry without understanding the implications of their relationship’s past or their future, especially concerning matrimonial agreements about community property and spousal support.

**FULL TEXT**
> After dating for several years, Alison and Billy decided to take a break from dating. In
December 2016, during this break, Alison had sexual relations with her old boyfriend Chris, which
led to her becoming pregnant with Chris’s child. Almost immediately after having sex with Chris,
Alison realized that she wanted to be with Billy, and they started dating again. Alison never told
Billy about her relationship with Chris during the breakup.

> In January 2017, one week after Alison and Billy got back together, on a night when Billy
was heavily drinking, Alison and Billy decided to get married on the spur of the moment. They
visited a friend who was a validly licensed minister, who performed the marriage ceremony with
a few friends serving as witnesses. When he woke up the next day, Billy did not remember getting
married even after Alison and their friends told him about it. Nonetheless, he was still happy with
the decision, and Alison and Billy began living together as husband and wife.
Soon after the wedding ceremony, Billy presented Alison with two proposed agreements:
one that provided that, in the event of a divorce, each spouse fully and irrevocably waived any and
all rights to both interim and final periodic support; and one that provided that each spouse opted
out of the community property regime. Billy and Alison then signed both agreements before a
notary and two witnesses.

> In September 2017, approximately eight months after the wedding ceremony, Alison gave
birth to a son, Sam. She had still not told Billy about her relationship with Chris, and Billy raised
Sam as his own child. However, Alison secretly conducted a paternity test using Billy’s hair
sample without his knowledge; the test confirmed that Billy was not Sam’s father.

> In 2018, Alison inherited $100,000 from her aunt. Because Billy was unemployed at the
time, she put this inheritance into a joint banking account with Billy. This account held all of their
funds, including her paychecks, his unemployment checks, and then his paychecks when he later
found a new job. They used the funds in this bank account for their general living expenses.

> In 2019, Alison and Billy had a daughter, Darla. Billy is Darla’s biological father.

> In September 2022, five years after Sam was born, Billy was looking through paperwork
on Alison’s desk, where he found the paternity test results. Billy confronted Alison about it, and
she confessed that she had had sex with Chris right before the marriage ceremony and that Sam
was Chris’s child.

> Billy was upset and distraught by this news, but nonetheless stayed in the family home.
One night in March 2023, he went out drinking and met Gretchen at a bar. Thinking that Alison
was staying over with Sam and Darla at her mother’s house, Billy brought Gretchen home. When
Alison returned home unexpectedly, she saw Billy and Gretchen engaged in sexual relations.

> Alison and Billy spent the next three weeks discussing their relationship and engaged in
sexual relations on a couple of occasions. After those three weeks, Alison and Billy both decided
that they could not remain married with such significant trust issues. In April 2023, Billy moved
out of the house. He and Alison have been living separate and apart since then. As of today, there
is $50,000 in their joint checking account.

**Questions**
1) Are Alison and Billy legally married? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question examines the validity of a marriage that occurred under potentially invalid circumstances (one party being intoxicated) and the subsequent acceptance and ratification of the marriage by living together as husband and wife.


**Answer**
Yes, Alison and Billy are legally married. In Louisiana, a marriage is considered valid if it is entered into freely by both parties. Although Billy was intoxicated at the time of the marriage, his subsequent acceptance of the marriage, evidenced by living together as husband and wife and not contesting the marriage, ratifies the marriage under Louisiana law.

2) What are each spouse’s options for divorce? What potential time delays, benefits and complications are associated with each option? Explain. (10 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question seeks to explore the legal grounds for divorce, focusing on fault-based and no-fault divorce options in Louisiana, and the implications of prenuptial agreements.


**Answer**
In Louisiana, spouses have the option for a no-fault divorce after living separate and apart for a legally specified period, or a fault-based divorce immediately under certain conditions. Given the prenuptial agreements and the circumstances (infidelity, substance abuse), both parties might consider a fault-based divorce for immediate separation. However, the prenuptial agreements may complicate claims for spousal support or property division.

3) Did Billy and Alison validly waive their right to interim and/or final spousal support through the agreements? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question assesses the enforceability of prenuptial agreements concerning spousal support under Louisiana law.

**Answer**


Yes, if the prenuptial agreements were made in compliance with Louisiana law—signed freely, with full disclosure, and notarized—they can validly waive rights to interim and final spousal support. The court will enforce such waivers unless they result in an unconscionable outcome at the time of divorce.

4) Assume solely for this Question 1.4 that neither Alison nor Billy signed any agreement relating to interim or final spousal support. If Billy seeks both types of support from Alison, is there any other basis for Alison to challenge an award of interim and/or final spousal support in favor of Billy other than lack of need? Explain. (4 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question explores the factors courts consider in awarding spousal support absent a prenuptial agreement.

**Answer**
Beyond lack of need, Alison could challenge spousal support on the grounds of Billy's fault in the breakdown of the marriage (e.g., infidelity, substance abuse) if such behavior is recognized under Louisiana law as a factor in denying support.


---

5) Have Alison and Billy validly opted out of Louisiana’s community property regime? Explain. (5 points)


**Tips & Analysis**
This explores the effectiveness and legal standing of prenuptial agreements concerning the community property regime.

**Answer**
Yes, provided the agreement to opt-out of the community property regime was made in accordance with Louisiana law—meaning it was signed voluntarily, with full disclosure, and properly notarized—they have validly opted out. This affects the division of property upon divorce, with each party retaining what they brought into the marriage and what was acquired individually thereafter.


---

6) Assume solely for this Question 1.6 that Alison and Billy did not opt out of the community property regime. Is any portion of the $50,000 in the joint checking account Alison’s separate property? Explain. (8 points)


**Tips & Analysis**
This question examines the classification of funds in a joint checking account under the community property regime.

**Answer**
Without opting out, the funds in the joint checking account, including the $100,000 inheritance mixed with marital funds, would typically be considered community property. However, if Alison can trace her inheritance as the source of some funds, she may argue for those to be recognized as her separate property.

7) Assume solely for this Question 1.7 that earlier today (in July 2023) Billy filed an action to disavow paternity of Sam. Is that action timely? Explain. (3 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question addresses the timeliness and legal requirements for filing an action to disavow paternity in Louisiana.

**Answer**
In Louisiana, an action to disavow paternity must be filed within a specific time frame from when the husband learns or should have learned of the birth of the child or the facts establishing the lack of paternity. Given that Billy discovered the paternity test results in September 2022, filing an action in July 2023 may be considered timely, depending on the specific statutory period in effect.
