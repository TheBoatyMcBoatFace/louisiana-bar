# Business Ethics
Business Ethics and Corporate Governance fundamentally cover the ethical obligations and governance principles guiding corporate conduct in Louisiana. This section emphasizes the significance of directors' and officers' fiduciary duties, ethical decision-making, and the transparent operation of business entities. Key topics include the prevention of conflicts of interest, ensuring fair treatment of shareholders, compliance with laws governing securities and financial reporting, and the enforcement of ethical standards within corporate cultures. Additionally, it scrutinizes shareholder rights, mechanisms to address director conflicts, and the implications of corporate actions on stakeholders' interests. This section underscores the balance between corporate objectives with ethical considerations and legal compliance, aiming to instill a framework for ethical leadership and sustainable corporate practices.

## Flash Facts
What should you know as you walk into the test center:

- **Fiduciary Duties:** Directors and officers owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the corporation. This means acting in the best interest of the corporation, avoiding conflicts of interest, and making informed decisions.

- **Preemptive Rights:** These rights allow existing shareholders to maintain their proportional ownership in the corporation by purchasing additional shares before the corporation offers them to the public.

- **Director Conflicts of Interest:** Any direct or indirect personal interest a director has in a transaction involving the corporation must be disclosed to the board. Failure to disclose can lead to transactions being voided or voidable.

- **Shareholder Inspection Rights:** Under certain conditions, shareholders have the right to inspect corporate records. This right is intended to allow shareholders to ensure transparency and accountability in corporate governance.

- **Cumulative Voting:** A method used in elections of directors which allows shareholders to concentrate their votes on fewer candidates than there are positions available, potentially allowing minority shareholders to secure representation on the board.

- **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** Under certain circumstances, courts may hold shareholders personally liable for corporate debts if the corporation is found to be their alter ego, or if corporate formalities are not observed, leading to unfairness or fraud.

- **Derivative Actions:** Shareholders may bring lawsuits on behalf of the corporation to enforce rights when the corporation itself has failed to enforce those rights.

- **Duty to Disclose:** Directors must disclose material information relevant to the corporation’s affairs. An undisclosed conflict of interest may result in transactions being reversed or damages awarded.

- **Unanimous Governance Agreement:** In Louisiana, this agreement among shareholders can modify typical governance structures, offering flexibility in absence of standard norms.

## Preparation and Application
Understanding the underlying principles of business ethics and their application within the framework of Louisiana law is crucial. This preparation involves a thorough review of case law, statutes, and procedural rules that govern business conduct, conflicts of interest, corporate governance, shareholder rights, and fiduciary duties in Louisiana.

**Focus Areas:**

1. **Review of Louisiana Law:** Begin with a solid understanding of the Louisiana Civil Code and related statutes that impact business operations and ethics, including those specific to corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies (LLCs).

2. **Case Law Analysis:** Examine landmark and recent cases in Louisiana that highlight ethical dilemmas, conflicts of interest, duties of directors and officers, shareholder rights, and dispute resolution within the context of business operations.

3. **Corporate Governance:** Deeply understand the roles, responsibilities, and duties of corporate directors, officers, and shareholders. Focus on how these roles intersect with ethical considerations and legal obligations.

4. **Ethical Conflict Resolution:** Prepare to analyze scenarios where business law intersects with ethical considerations, understanding both legal requirements and ethical decision-making frameworks.

5. **Application via Hypotheticals:** Practice applying your knowledge to hypothetical scenarios that mirror potential exam questions or real-world dilemmas. This will help in understanding the practical application of business ethics within Louisiana's legal framework.

6. **Preemptive Rights and Shareholder Agreements:** Understand the specifics of shareholder agreements, preemptive rights, and unanimous governance agreements within Louisiana corporations and LLCs, as these areas are ripe for ethical examination.

7. **Statutory Requirements and Procedural Rules:** Ensure familiarity with procedural rules and statutory requirements governing business entities in Louisiana, focusing on areas like formation, operation, dissolution, and especially the reporting and disclosure obligations that could raise ethical issues.

8. **Recent Legislative Changes:** Stay updated on any recent changes in Louisiana statutory law or case law precedents that affect business ethics, corporate governance, or shareholder rights.

**Preparatory Steps:**

- **Compile Key Resources:** Gather relevant statutes, casebooks, ethical guidelines, and commentary specific to Louisiana business law.
- **Engagement with Hypotheticals:** Regular practice with hypothetical situations can sharpen your ability to quickly identify ethical issues and apply legal principles to resolve them.
- **Group Study and Discussion:** Engage with peers in discussions and debates over ethical dilemmas in business, focusing on the nuanced application of law.
- **Seminars and CLE Courses:** Consider attending seminars or Continuing Legal Education (CLE) courses focused on business ethics and Louisiana law.

**Applying Knowledge:**

To effectively apply knowledge in the exam and professional practice:
- **Analyze Fact Patterns:** Learn to quickly dissect fact patterns to identify legal issues and the ethical dilemmas entangled within them.
- **Ethical Decision Framework:** Apply a consistent ethical decision-making framework to exam questions and real-world legal problems.
- **Legal Writing Practice:** Hone your legal writing skills to articulate complex arguments clearly and concisely, ensuring that ethical considerations are clearly outlined and addressed.
- **Stay Informed:** Regularly read legal journals and news related to business law and ethics to understand emerging trends and ethical discussions in the legal community.







## Case Questions
Sample cases offer practical applications of these principles, showcasing potential challenges and resolutions within legal scenarios framed by the Louisiana Civil Code and related statutes.


### Case 1: Authority in Partnerships and the Consequences of Unauthorized Actions
Unauthorized actions by a partner lead to legal challenges for a partnership, including an ineffective manager withdrawal and a substantial personal injury judgment without means for compensation.

**Background**
> Andrew, Bob, Claire, and Dan started a business together manufacturing and selling specialized computer keyboards for gamers. They signed the following agreement:
>
> **Partnership Agreement**
> 1. We agree to form a partnership constituted without a term, and its name shall be The Keyboard Company (“TKC”).
> 2. Andrew will serve as the manager of the business.
> 3. Each of the partners will contribute $10,000 to TKC.
> 4. The partners will share equally in the profits of the business.
> 5. Bob, Claire, and Dan will have no mandatary relationship with TKC and no authority to bind TKC in the performance of any contractual obligations.
> 6. Dan will not be involved in the daily operations of TKC, and he will not be liable to third persons for the obligations or liabilities incurred by TKC.
>
>Andrew, Bob, Claire, and Dan each sent $10,000 to TKC’s bank account. Andrew used the funds to purchase tools, equipment, and parts needed to build keyboards. He named the keyboards Blasterboards and offered them for sale at $500 each.
>
>Claire met with her friend Rusty, who owns an electronics store. Claire told Rusty about TKC and its Blasterboards. Rusty offered to purchase 20 Blasterboards if TKC would give him a volume discount. Without consulting with Andrew, Claire agreed to a 50% discount and signed the following agreement with Rusty: “TKC agrees to sell 20 Blasterboards to Rusty for $5,000. The keyboards will be delivered to Rusty within 6 months, and payment is due at time of delivery.” Claire signed the agreement on behalf of TKC.
>
>The following day, Claire told Andrew about the agreement she signed with Rusty. Andrew told Claire that she did not have authority to sign the agreement on behalf of TKC. Andrew instructed Claire to tell Rusty the agreement is off. But Claire was too embarrassed to tell Rusty anything.
>
>A few days later, Claire visited her cousin Violet. Violet hosts a popular internet website known as “Gamer’s Guide,” which publishes reviews on gaming keyboards. Violet told Claire that she recently purchased a Blasterboard and that it was the best gaming keyboard she had ever used. Violet commented that TKC was going to make a fortune. Claire didn’t think so, and she offered to sell Violet her partnership interest in TKC for $10,000. Violet accepted. Claire didn’t inform Andrew, Bob, or Dan about her sale of the partnership interest to Violet.
>
>The following day, Violet published on the Gamer’s Guide website a glowing review of the Blasterboard, and orders for Blasterboards began flooding into TKC. To meet the sudden increased demand for Blasterboards, Andrew asked Bob, Claire, and Dan to each contribute $50,000 to the partnership to fund the hiring of new employees to assist Andrew in manufacturing Blasterboards. Bob, Claire, and Dan declined to contribute funds to expand production. In response, Andrew notified Bob, Claire, and Dan that, effective immediately, he was resigning as manager and withdrawing from the partnership.
>
>Earlier that same day, TKC’s first customer, Michael, suffered severe burns to his face and hands when his Blasterboard caught fire and exploded. Michael brought a lawsuit against TKC for personal injury. The court awarded Michael a judgment against TKC for $100,000. TKC has no cash or other assets and no insurance to pay the judgment.


**Questions**

**1.1** Is TKC bound to the agreement that Claire signed with Rusty? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on the authority defined in the partnership agreement and the actions taken by Claire in relation to that authority. Consider the principles governing partnerships, especially regarding the binding authority of individual partners and unauthorized acts. A thorough answer will address the specific limitations on Claire's authority mentioned in the partnership agreement and the implications of those limitations on the contract with Rusty.

**Answer**
TKC may not be bound by the agreement Claire signed with Rusty because Claire, according to the partnership agreement, did not have the authority to bind TKC in any contractual obligations without the consensus of the other partners, especially considering that Bob, Claire, and Dan were explicitly stated to have no mandatary relationship with TKC. Since Claire acted without consulting Andrew or obtaining his approval, the contract with Rusty could be considered unauthorized and potentially voidable by TKC.

**1.2** Was Andrew’s withdrawal from TKC effective? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Analyze the relevant partnership laws that apply to withdrawal in the absence of specific provisions in the partnership agreement. Consider the effect of Andrew's actions and any implied consent that may arise from the actions or inactions of the other partners following his notice of withdrawal. Additionally, reflect on how the partnership agreement structures the withdrawal process, if at all.

**Answer**
Andrew's withdrawal from the partnership is effective only if it complies with the terms of the partnership agreement and the applicable laws governing partnership dissolution in Louisiana. Given that the partnership agreement does not specify conditions for withdrawal or dissolution, and in the absence of explicit statutory provisions to the contrary, Andrew’s notification of his intent to withdraw can be considered an effective unilateral act of withdrawal from the partnership.

**1.3** For each of the following persons—Andrew, Bob, Claire, Dan, and Violet—determine whether he/she is liable for payment of any amount of the $100,000 judgment
awarded to Michael. Explain the basis for your conclusions on liability; and for each individual, state the dollar amount, if any, for which he/she is liable. (20 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
The key here is understanding the distinctions between various types of liability within partnerships and the implications of inheriting or obtaining a membership interest. Consider how liability is addressed within the Partnership Agreement and how state law might influence or allocate liability among partners and their successors.

**Answer**
Andrew, Bob, Claire, and Dan may all bear liability for the judgment as active partners at the time of the accident, depending on how the partnership agreement addresses liability and whether their state’s laws consider partners jointly and severally liable for the actions taken in the course of partnership business. Since they are part of a member-managed entity with equal shares, they could be held equally liable, suggesting a division of the $100,000 judgment among them, assuming state law does not prescribe otherwise.

Violet, as the inheritor of Claire’s membership interest, may not be directly liable for the judgment against TKC given the timing and manner of her acquiring the interest, especially if her assumption of interest is limited to economic rights and does not include management or operational responsibilities or liabilities incurred prior to her membership.


**1.4** Solely for purposes of this question 1.4, assume that (i) instead of executing the Partnership Agreement described above and forming a partnership, Andrew, Bob,
Claire, and Dan validly formed a member-managed Louisiana limited liability company known as TKC LLC and (ii) Claire has assigned all of her rights in TKC LLC to Violet
without informing the other members of TKC LLC that she had done so, and (iii) Michael has obtained a $100,000 judgment against TKC LLC for his personal injuries.

**1.4.a** What right, if any, does Violet have to inspect TKC’s business records? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on the rights of LLC members under Louisiana law regarding the inspection of business records. Consider the nature of Violet’s membership and any provisions in the operating agreement that might restrict or elaborate on members' rights to inspect records. The key is understanding how the law balances members' rights to information against the LLC’s interest in confidentiality and efficient operation.

**Answer**
As a member of a member-managed Louisiana limited liability company, Violet would generally have the right to inspect and copy the LLC’s business records for purposes reasonably related to her interest as a member. This right can be subject to reasonable restrictions or conditions in the LLC’s operating agreement. Since Claire assigned her rights in TKC LLC to Violet without specifying otherwise, Violet inherits Claire’s rights, including rights to inspect business records, under Louisiana LLC laws.

**1.4.b**  As a member of TKC LLC, is Bob personally liable for any amount of the $100,000 judgment the court awarded against TKC LLC? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
The primary focus should be on the protections offered by the limited liability company structure, specifically regarding personal liability for company obligations. It’s important to understand and articulate the conditions under which these protections apply and the rationale behind them, considering both statutory law and principles of LLC governance.

**Answer**
As a member of a limited liability company in Louisiana, Bob would generally not be personally liable for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of TKC LLC, including judgments against the LLC. The LLC structure is designed to provide its members with protection from personal liability, ensuring that their risk is limited to their investment in the company. This means Bob would not be personally liable for the $100,000 judgment awarded against TKC LLC, assuming the LLC was properly formed and operated in accordance with state law and the principles governing LLCs.

### Case 2: Director's Conflicting Interest and Liability in Corporate Transactions
A corporation's directors overpaid for assets due to a conflict of interest involving an undisclosed personal connection, leading to legal action to recover losses.

**Background**
> LDL Corp. is a validly-formed Louisiana corporation that owns and operates fast-food restaurants throughout the state. Tim, Stan, and Heather, who have no familial relationship to each other, are the sole shareholders of LDL Corp. Tim, Stan, and Heather are also the directors of LDL Corp.
>
> LDL’s directors convened a meeting to consider an offer received from LDL’s main competitor, Hot Wings, Inc., to sell several Hot Wings restaurants to LDL for $10 million. Without obtaining an independent estimate of the value of the restaurants offered for sale, LDL’s directors unanimously voted to accept the offer. At the time of the vote, Tim was engaged to be married to Matilda. He knew that Matilda was Hot Wings, Inc.’s sole shareholder and that the restaurants offered for sale were worth no more than $5 million. Tim did not disclose these facts to Stan and Heather prior to the vote by the directors. Neither the directors nor the shareholders took any further action to authorize or ratify the purchase.
>
> Following the vote and LDL’s purchase of the Hot Wings restaurants, Stan saw a news story involving Hot Wings and began investigating. Stan discovered the worth of Hot Wings and that LDL had overpaid by $5 million dollars for the stores that it had purchased from Hot Wings. Stan and Heather, on behalf of LDL, brought an action against Tim to recover the loss.

**Questions**

**2.1.a** Was the vote by the LDL directors a Director’s Conflicting Interest Transaction? Explain. (4 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on understanding what constitutes a Director’s Conflicting Interest Transaction. This involves recognizing situations where a director has a direct or indirect interest in a transaction that the board of directors approves. Key factors include whether the director’s interest was disclosed to the board and whether the transaction was fair to the corporation at the time it was authorized, approved, or ratified.

**Answer**
Yes, the vote by the LDL directors was a Director’s Conflicting Interest Transaction. Tim, as a director of LDL Corp., had a direct personal interest in the transaction due to his relationship with Matilda, Hot Wings, Inc.’s sole shareholder. His failure to disclose this interest and the fact that he knew the restaurants were worth half the purchase price represents a conflict that should have been disclosed to the other directors for an informed decision.


**2.1.b** Can Tim be held personally liable for payment of monetary damages to LDL resulting from his vote to accept Hot Wings’ offer? Explain. (6 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Consider the requirements and implications of directors' fiduciary duties, particularly in relation to disclosing conflicts of interest and ensuring transactions are in the best interests of the corporation. Also, analyze the potential for personal liability when these duties are breached.

**Answer**
Tim could be held personally liable for payment of monetary damages to LDL due to his undisclosed conflicting interest and his knowledge that the purchase price significantly exceeded the value of what was acquired. His actions violated his fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the corporation and to disclose any conflicts of interest, making him potentially liable for the resulting financial loss to LDL.


**2.2**
> Kitchen Design, L.P. (“KD”) is a validly formed Louisiana partnership in commendam that offers residential kitchen design and construction services. KD’s written partnership agreement filed with the secretary of state identifies Ken as a general partner and Sue and Charles as partners in commendam. The partnership agreement also states that Sue and Charles each will contribute $50,000 to the partnership. Sue made her contribution. Charles did not.
>
> Sue encouraged her best friend, Tina, to hire KD to design and build a kitchen for Tina’s new home. Sue met Tina at KD’s showroom several times to assist Tina in selecting appliances, cabinets, and countertops for her kitchen project and in taking Tina’s orders for her selections. Several months after KD completed work on the kitchen, Tina brought a lawsuit against KD alleging poor workmanship and breach of contract. Tina ultimately obtained a judgment for $100,000 against KD. KD currently has no assets or cash to satisfy the judgment. KD also owes $30,000 to Appliances, Inc. for payment of appliances KD purchased for various kitchen projects.


**2.2.a**Is Sue personally liable for any amount of either the judgment obtained by Tina or the debt owed to Appliances, Inc.? Explain. (4 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Distinguish the liability of general partners from that of partners in commendam (limited partners) in a Louisiana partnership in commendam. Consider the role and actions of Sue in regards to the partnership’s operations and how these might influence her liability.

**Answer**
Sue, as a partner in commendam, typically would not be personally liable for debts or judgments against the partnership beyond her capital contribution, provided she did not participate in management activities. However, her active involvement in the business, as detailed, may potentially blur the lines of her limited partner status and expose her to personal liability, depending on Louisiana law interpretation and if her actions are seen as taking on the role of a general partner.


**2.2.b**Is Charles personally liable for any amount of either the judgment obtained by Tina or the debt owed to Appliances, Inc.? Explain. (4 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Again, assess the distinction between general partners and partners in commendam in terms of liability. Consider Charles’s failure to contribute the agreed amount and its impact on liability.

**Answer**
Charles, also a partner in commendam, would generally not face personal liability beyond his promised contribution to the partnership, which he failed to make. His lack of involvement in the management of the partnership typically shields him from further liability for the partnership’s obligations unless specific actions or omissions on his part, such as his failure to contribute, directly contributed to the partnership’s liability.


**2.3** In a manager-managed limited liability company, what fiduciary duties, if any, are owed to the LLC by a member who is not a manager? Explain. (3 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Understand the nature of fiduciary duties within LLCs, especially differentiating between member-managed and manager-managed LLCs. Consider how the law regards non-managing members in relationship to these duties.

**Answer**
In a manager-managed LLC, a member who is not a manager typically owes limited fiduciary duties to the LLC. Their duties mainly pertain to avoiding actions that harm the LLC and acting in good faith. They are generally not involved in day-to-day decisions and thus their fiduciary responsibilities are significantly reduced compared to those of managers or members in a member-managed LLC.



**2.4** Under what circumstances, if any, may a partner be expelled from a partnership that is constituted for a term? Explain. (3 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Reflect on the Louisiana Revised Statutes and the partnership agreement’s provisions regarding the expulsion of a partner. Focus on both the legal grounds for expulsion and any procedural requirements detailed in the partnership agreement or applicable laws.

**Answer**
A partner may be expelled from a partnership constituted for a term under circumstances specified in the partnership agreement or, in its absence, for reasons such as a material breach of the partnership agreement, conduct that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the partner, or illegal behavior. The specifics of expulsion would typically need to be outlined in the partnership agreement, as statutory law provides a framework but emphasizes the agreement’s provisions.


**2.5** May a corporation unilaterally compel a shareholder to sell its shares to the corporation? Explain. (2 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Investigate the concepts of "drag-along rights" and "mandatory share redemption" as they apply under corporate law. Consider how these mechanisms work and under what conditions they can be invoked.

**Answer**
Generally, a corporation can only compel a shareholder to sell their shares back to the corporation if such actions are explicitly provided for in the corporation’s governing documents (e.g., bylaws or shareholder agreements) or under specific circumstances allowed by law, such as dissolution or merger. This mechanism must be established and agreed upon in advance; it cannot be unilaterally imposed after the fact.


**2.6** What is the statutory remedy provided for “shareholder oppression” under Louisiana law, and what conduct may constitute oppression? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Explore the definitions and examples of shareholder oppression under Louisiana law. Focus on legal remedies available for oppressed shareholders, such as buyouts or injunctions, and behaviors that are typically considered oppressive.


**Answer**
Under Louisiana law, shareholder oppression can include actions by the corporation or its controlling shareholders that are unfairly prejudicial towards one or more shareholders. This might involve denying a shareholder access to corporate records, improper termination of shareholder employment, or distributing dividends in a discriminatory manner. Remedies may include a court-ordered buyout of the oppressed shareholder’s stakes at a fair value, among other statutory remedies.


**2.7** What is a “unanimous governance agreement” (UGA) under Louisiana law; how is a UGA formed; and are there any limitations on what a UGA can do? Explain. (4 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Understand the concept of a UGA and its formation requirements, including the necessity for unanimity among parties. Evaluate the scope and limitations of a UGA, recognizing what it can and cannot govern or alter within the corporate structure.

**Answer**
A Unanimous Governance Agreement under Louisiana law is a special type of agreement that allows shareholders, members, or partners in a business entity to establish rules governing aspects of the entity’s governance and operation, different from or in addition to those established in the entity’s standard governing documents. A UGA requires the unanimous consent of all parties involved and is formally executed in writing. While a UGA can significantly alter governance and operational norms, it cannot contravene public policy or laws mandating specific governance practices or requiring certain entity actions.


**2.8** Sharon owns 10% of the outstanding common shares of a Louisiana corporation. She has owned the shares for more than a year. She wants to inspect the records of how a particular director voted at meetings of the corporation’s board of directors during the past year. Does Sharon have a right to inspect such records, and, if so, what, if any, requirement(s) must she satisfy in order to be permitted to inspect such records? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Look into shareholder rights within corporate governance, particularly regarding access to records. Assess what grounds or conditions a shareholder must meet to exercise these rights and whether Sharon’s situation fits these criteria.

**Answer**
Sharon, as a shareholder holding more than 5% of the outstanding common shares for over a year, generally has a statutory right to inspect certain corporate records under Louisiana law. She must make her request in good faith and for a proper purpose. The law might require her to describe with reasonable particularity her purpose and the records she wishes to inspect. This right is meant to ensure transparency and allow shareholders to effectively monitor and engage with corporate governance.

### Case 3: Corporate Governance and Shareholder Rights Violations
In a saga of internal conflicts and ethically questionable decisions, a corporation's board approves an overpriced asset purchase from a company secretly owned by a member of the board, leading to disputes over authority, shareholder rights, and corporate governance ethics.

**Background**
> Bernard, Emily, and Abby decided to go into business together to open and operate a restaurant, and they validly formed Good Food, Inc. (“Good Food”) in Louisiana for that purpose. Good Food’s articles of incorporation provide that it will have three directors; that Bernard, Emily, and Abby will serve as the initial directors; and that the corporation is authorized to issue 10,000 shares of stock. The articles also provide that no shareholder may inspect the records of Good Food unless the shareholder is an officer, director, or employee of Good Food.
>
> Last year, on February 1, at a properly-convened meeting of the board of directors, Bernard, Emily, and Abby voted unanimously: (1) to appoint Bernard president and secretary of Good Food; (2) to authorize Bernard to negotiate the purchase of a suitable location for a restaurant; (3) to issue 2,000 shares each to Bernard, Emily, and Abby; and (4) to issue 4,000 shares to Courtney in exchange for her investment of $200,000 in cash.
>
> One month later, on March 1, at a properly-convened meeting of the board of directors, Bernard reported to Emily and Abby that he had found a perfect location for a restaurant—a warehouse owned by Family Holdings, Inc. (“Family Holdings”). Bernard explained that the warehouse was not listed for sale, but that he had negotiated with Family Holdings to purchase the warehouse for $500,000. Bernard told Emily and Abby that $500,000 was a fair and reasonable price for the warehouse, and he recommended that the board vote to approve the purchase. Emily and Abby asked no questions, and Bernard provided no additional information about Family Holdings or the warehouse. The directors voted unanimously to approve the purchase.
>
> On April 1, Good Food and Family Holdings executed an act of the sale, and Good Food became the owner of the warehouse. Within a week, Bernard hired a construction team, which began work converting the warehouse to a restaurant. Shortly thereafter, Bernard became romantically involved with Emily, and for several months Bernard was so preoccupied with seeing Emily that he spent little time overseeing the construction work at the warehouse.
>
> On July 1, Abby visited the warehouse and spoke with Stan, the leader of the construction team. Stan informed Abby that the construction was several weeks behind schedule due to a delay in purchasing a walk-in refrigeration unit for the restaurant. As Stan explained, two months ago he and Bernard had met with the president of Refrigeration, Inc. (“RI”) and selected a refrigeration unit to purchase for the restaurant. RI’s president provided Bernard a purchase order detailing the terms of the sale—specifically that RI agreed to sell the refrigeration unit to Good Food for $100,000, with payment due ten days after delivery of the unit. Stan told Abby that Bernard had not signed the purchase order and that he had not seen or heard from Bernard since the meeting with RI’s president. Stan provided a copy of the purchase order to Abby and urged her to sign it in Bernard’s absence. Abby carefully reviewed the purchase order and attempted several times to contact Bernard to discuss the purchase order. But Bernard did not respond. Before leaving the warehouse that day, Abby signed the purchase order as “Abby, Member of Good Food Board of Directors,” and instructed Stan to deliver the signed purchase order to RI that day.
>
> On July 15, RI delivered the refrigeration unit to Good Food’s warehouse. The next day, Bernard went to the warehouse, saw that the refrigeration unit had been delivered, and learned then that Abby had signed the purchase order. Bernard demanded that RI take back the refrigeration unit, claiming that Abby had no authority to sign the purchase order on behalf of Good Food. RI refused and demanded that Good Food honor its agreement to pay RI $100,000 for the refrigeration unit.
>
> That evening, Bernard and Emily were married. At the wedding reception, Courtney overheard Bernard and his brother discussing Family Holdings and the warehouse. She learned that Bernard and his brother had formed Family Holdings in 2020; that Bernard owned 60% of Family Holdings’ total authorized shares since its formation; and that Family Holdings purchased the warehouse for $100,000 just a few months before it sold the warehouse to Good Food, based on an appraisal that was completed on the day Family Holdings purchased the warehouse. That appraisal valued the warehouse at $100,000.
>
> Three months after the wedding, Good Food’s board of directors received a letter from Courtney detailing what she had learned in overhearing Bernard’s conversation with his brother. Courtney demanded that Good Food’s board of directors remove Bernard as a director and require Bernard to pay Good Food $400,000—the difference between the price that Good Food paid for the warehouse and the amount for which the warehouse appraised when Family Holdings acquired it.
>
> The next day, at a properly-convened meeting of the board of directors, Bernard admitted to Emily and Abby that Courtney’s claims were all true. He also admitted that the warehouse was worth $100,000 when the Good Food's board voted to authorize its purchase of the warehouse for $500,000. Bernard left the room, and directors Emily and Abby voted unanimously to approve and ratify Good Food’s purchase of the warehouse for $500,000. They also passed a resolution stating that Good Food’s board of directors remained fully confident in Bernard’s ability to serve as a director and officer of Good Food; that the board would not remove Bernard as a director or officer; and that the board would not require Bernard to pay any amount to Good Food for any reason relating to Good Food’s purchase of the warehouse. Emily mailed a copy of the resolution to Courtney that day with a cover letter stating: “Courtney, this is what you get for eavesdropping at my wedding.”
>
> Since receiving the copy of the resolution from Emily, Courtney has sent numerous letters to Good Food’s board of directors requesting access to inspect Good Food’s corporate records. The board has refused all of her requests based on the provision in Good Food’s articles of incorporation that a shareholder may not inspect Good Food’s records unless the shareholder is an officer, director, or employee of Good Food. And most recently, the board of directors sent a letter to Courtney last month demanding that she stop bothering them with her “silly” requests and threatened to exclude her from all Good Food shareholder events and meetings.
>

**Questions**

**3.1** What duties, if any, did Bernard breach by his actions involving Good Food’s purchase of the warehouse? Explain fully. (6 points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Consider the fiduciary duties Bernard owes to Good Food, Inc. as both a director and an officer, focusing on the duty of loyalty and the duty of candor. Reflect on how his undisclosed ownership interest in Family Holdings and the overvaluation of the warehouse purchase may constitute a breach of these duties.

**Answer**
Bernard breached his fiduciary duties of loyalty and candor by failing to disclose his significant ownership interest in Family Holdings, Inc., the company from which Good Food purchased the warehouse. By recommending the purchase of the warehouse for $500,000—a price significantly higher than its actual value of $100,000, and failing to disclose that Family Holdings had recently acquired it for that amount, Bernard acted in his own interest rather than in the best interest of Good Food, violating his duty of loyalty. Additionally, by not providing complete and truthful information about the transaction and his conflict of interest, Bernard also breached his duty of candor to Good Food and its shareholders.


**3.2** Can Bernard be held liable for payment of damages to Good Food for any loss or harm Good Food might have sustained in purchasing the warehouse from Family Holdings for $500,000? Explain fully. (15 points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Analyze the potential legal consequences Bernard may face due to his conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duties. Consider the implications of the overpayment for the warehouse and examine how the law might allow Good Food to recover damages from Bernard.

**Answer**
Bernard can likely be held liable for damages to Good Food due to his undisclosed conflict of interest and misrepresentation of the warehouse's value. Given that Bernard owned a significant portion of Family Holdings and stood to benefit personally from the transaction, his actions led to Good Food overpaying for the warehouse by $400,000. Under corporate governance principles, directors who breach their fiduciary duties to the company by engaging in self-dealing or failing to disclose conflicts of interest may be required to make restitution for any resulting losses or damages. Therefore, Good Food could have a strong case to recover the $400,000 overpayment as damages from Bernard.


**3.3** Does Courtney have a right to inspect Good Food’s corporate records? Explain fully. (5 points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Examine the shareholder rights to inspect corporate records under relevant law, given the specific provisions in Good Food’s articles of incorporation. Discuss whether these provisions can override statutory rights and under what circumstances, if any, Courtney might overcome the barriers to inspection as presented.

**Answer**
While Good Food's articles of incorporation state that shareholders may not inspect corporate records unless they are officers, directors, or employees, this provision potentially conflicts with statutory laws that offer shareholders the right to inspect records for proper purposes. Given Courtney’s attempt to uncover possible mismanagement or wrongdoing by Bernard, a court may find that she has a legitimate interest, granting her the right to inspect the relevant corporate records despite the restrictive provision in Good Food’s articles of incorporation.


**3.4** What amount, if any, can RI recover from Good Food for payment of the refrigeration unit? Explain fully. (6 points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Consider the principles of agency and authority in corporate governance. Delve into whether Abby, as a director, had either actual or apparent authority to sign the purchase order in Bernard's absence, and what consequences follow regarding the corporation's liability to RI.

**Answer**
RI can likely recover the full $100,000 from Good Food for the refrigeration unit. Although Bernard contested Abby's authority to sign the purchase order, Abby's position as a member of the board of directors and her action taken to ensure the continuation of vital construction work could be interpreted as her having apparent authority. Since Abby acted in the interest of Good Food and within the scope of her role to mitigate delays in the construction project, Good Food is likely bound by the agreement she signed with RI.


**3.5** Courtney has brought an action under Louisiana law to withdraw from Good Food and require Good Food to buy her shares at fair value based on shareholder
oppression. Is she likely to succeed? Explain fully. (8 points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Assess the concept of shareholder oppression, focusing on the actions and inactions of Good Food's board of directors that might constitute such behavior. Evaluate the likelihood of a court finding that Courtney has been oppressed as a shareholder and her entitlement to relief, such as a forced buyout of her shares.

**Answer**
Courtney may have a strong case for shareholder oppression, given the board's refusal to address her legitimate concerns regarding Bernard's self-dealing and the subsequent dismissal and belittling of her requests to inspect corporate records. Shareholder oppression often involves actions that substantially disregard the interests or rights of a shareholder, and the board's threatening response and exclusionary tactics towards Courtney could be viewed as oppressive behavior. If a court agrees that Courtney's rights as a shareholder have been disregarded or violated to her detriment, she might succeed in her action to withdraw and require Good Food to buy her shares at a fair value.

### Case 4: Breach of Contract and Partnership Duties in Construction
A partnership agreement's breach due to failure in capital contribution results in a construction contract violation, leading to consideration of new business formation to fulfill project commitments.


**4.1**
> Mason and Oscar formed a validly organized partnership (“MO Partnership”) to construct modular homes. They agreed that Mason would contribute $50,000 in cash to fund the purchase of materials and that Oscar would perform the construction services to build the homes. Mason’s contribution would be made within 30 days after MO Partnership was formed. They further agreed to share the profits equally.
>
> Six weeks later, a subdivision developer and MO Partnership signed a construction contract under which MO Partnership agreed to build 10 homes for the developer. Before purchasing any materials for this work, Oscar received MO Partnership’s bank statement and discovered that Mason’s $50,000 contribution had not been made. Oscar asked Mason to make the contribution, since they needed working capital to purchase the materials to build the homes for the subdivision developer.
>
> Citing monetary problems, Mason refused to put up his contribution and told Oscar that he would need at least three to four months before he would be able to raise the money. The lack of funds caused MO Partnership to breach the construction contract with the developer. Angry with Mason’s failure to make his agreed contribution, Oscar is considering forming his own company to take over the project.

What steps might Oscar take to create a new business entity for the purpose of taking over the construction project? Explain fully. (6 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Consider the steps involved in forming a new business entity, such as choosing the type of entity (e.g., LLC, corporation), registering with the state, obtaining necessary licenses or permits, and potentially drafting an operating agreement or bylaws. Also, think about the implications of transferring the construction project contract to the new entity.

**Answer**
Oscar should first decide on the type of business entity that best suits his needs, possibly a limited liability company (LLC) for its flexibility and protection against personal liability. He would then need to:
    1. Choose a unique name for the LLC that complies with state requirements.
    2. File articles of organization with the Louisiana Secretary of State, including the LLC's name, purpose, office address, and the names of its members.
    3. Obtain an EIN from the IRS for tax purposes.
    4. Draft an operating agreement to outline the operation of the LLC and the rights and responsibilities of the members, even though it's not mandatory in many states.
    5. Apply for any necessary building and construction permits or licenses required to legally operate in the construction industry within the state and the specific locality.
    6. Negotiate with the subdivision developer to assign or newly contract the project to his newly created business entity, ensuring to adhere to any terms regarding transferability or novation in the original contract with MO Partnership.



**4.2** Which contracts does a single partner, acting alone, have the authority to enter into on behalf of the partnership? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Discuss the general powers of partners in a partnership to bind the partnership, focusing on acts that are within the ordinary course of the partnership’s business. Consider any limitations or requirements for such authority to apply.

**Answer**
Generally, a single partner has the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the partnership for actions that fall within the ordinary course of the partnership’s business. This includes any contracts necessary or incidental to conducting the partnership’s primary business activities. However, actions that would bind the partnership to matters outside the regular scope of its business or transactions requiring the consent of all partners under the partnership agreement or law (e.g., selling a significant portion of the partnership's assets) would not fall under a single partner's unilateral authority. Partners must act in the partnership's best interests and within their granted powers to avoid personal liability or disputes among partners.


**4.3** Paula is a partner of a partnership. If a third party files a lawsuit against Paula by virtue of her status as a partner of the partnership, and Paula successfully defends the suit, is Paula automatically entitled to reimbursement from the partnership for reasonable attorneys’ fees Paula incurred in defending the suit? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Analyze the implications of partnership responsibilities concerning legal defense and the criteria for reimbursement of costs incurred by a partner in defense of actions related to the partnership business.

**Answer**
Under most partnership laws, Paula would be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable attorney’s fees and other defense costs from the partnership if the lawsuit was directly related to the partnership’s business and if she was acting in the scope of her role as a partner when the actions leading to the lawsuit occurred. The entitlement to reimbursement typically hinges on the partner’s actions being in accordance with their partnership duties and for the benefit or in the interest of the partnership.



**4.4** What information is required in the organizational document of a Louisiana partnership in commendam, and what are the filing requirements, if any? Explain fully. (4 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Examine the specific elements and filing requirements for a partnership in commendam (limited partnership) as distinguished from other business types, according to Louisiana law.


**Answer**
In Louisiana, the organizational document for a partnership in commendam (limited partnership) must include:
    1. The partnership name, which must comply with Louisiana law and include “limited partnership” or abbreviation.
    2. The address of the principal office.
    3. The name and address of the registered agent.
    4. The names and addresses of all general partners.
    5. The term (duration) of the partnership if it is not perpetual.
    6. The purpose of the partnership.
        This document must be filed with the Louisiana Secretary of State. Additionally, the partnership should also specify the contributions of each partner and outline the limited liability of the limited partners to preserve their status.


**4.5** For a partnership in commendam, what duties/responsibilities is a partner in commendam allowed to have and what activities, if any, must a partner in commendam avoid in order to preserve his/her limited liability protection? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Detail the distinction between the roles and limitations of action for a partner in commendam to maintain their limited liability status in the partnership.

**Answer**
A partner in commendam (limited partner) is typically not involved in the day-to-day management of the partnership business, allowing them to maintain their limited liability protection. They may invest capital, participate in decision-making through voting on certain issues as outlined in the partnership agreement, and receive distributions. However, they must avoid engaging in the management or operational activities of the partnership. If a limited partner participates in the control of the business, they risk losing their limited-liability status and can become personally liable for the partnership’s debts and obligations, similar to a general partner.



**4.6**
> Troy and Barry decided to form a limited liability company. They executed and filed with the Secretary of State the proper organizational documents to form the LLC. These organizational documents contain only the minimum requirements for formation of the LLC, and the LLC has no operating agreement. After the LLC had been in operation for several years, Troy died. His son, Junior, who has been placed into possession of all of Troy’s assets by a proper judgment of possession in Troy’s succession proceedings, wants to become a member of the LLC.

Is Junior entitled to be admitted as a member of the LLC? Explain fully. (6 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Investigate the default rules regarding the transfer of LLC membership interests upon the death of a member, focusing on rights of successors under Louisiana law and the absence of an operating agreement.

**Answer**
Without an operating agreement that specifies otherwise, Junior is not automatically entitled to become a member of the LLC. Under most state laws, including Louisiana, the transfer of a deceased member’s interest generally entitles the heir to receive the financial benefits (such as distributions) associated with the membership interest, but not the managerial rights or the status as a member without the consent of the existing members. Therefore, Junior would likely need the remaining member’s approval to become a full member with management rights in the LLC.


**4.7** What are the differences in the formation and operation of a member-managed LLC and a manager-managed LLC? Explain fully. (5 points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Distinguish between member-managed and manager-managed LLCs in terms of their governance structures and operational authority.

**Answer**
In a member-managed LLC, all members participate equally in the management and decision-making processes of the LLC, with each member having one vote unless the operating agreement states otherwise. In contrast, a manager-managed LLC designates one or more managers (who can be members or outsiders) to handle the LLC’s daily operations and make decisions on its behalf. The members of a manager-managed LLC typically do not participate in daily management but may retain authority over significant decisions as defined in the operating agreement. The choice between these structures affects the LLC’s governance, liability, and functional operations, depending on the preferences of its members and the complexity of the business.






**4.8** For a manager-managed LLC, list four types of decisions that require the vote of the membership. (4 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Outline significant decisions within a manager-managed LLC that would still necessitate member approval, indicating the collaborative aspects of LLC governance.

**Answer**
In a manager-managed LLC, despite the delegation of daily management to the manager(s), certain major decisions require the vote of the membership, including:
Amendments to the LLC’s operating agreement or articles of organization.

    1. The sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the LLC’s assets outside the ordinary course of business.
    2. Mergers or conversions of the LLC into another entity.
    3. The dissolution and the commencement of winding up of the LLC.
    4. These decisions are generally reserved for members to ensure their direct involvement in the most significant aspects of the LLC’s governance and future direction.

### Case 5: Conflicts of Interest and Shareholder Actions in Business Sales
A conflict of interest in a substantial business sale decision leads to shareholder opposition and legal contention over the sale's validity and transparency.

**Background**
> Crazy Lanes, Inc. (“CLI”) owns and operates a popular bowling alley. CLI has three directors – Claire, Emily, and Rusty – and one officer, Margo, who serves as president and secretary. Claire and Rusty are married to each other. Other than names and street addresses, CLI’s articles of incorporation provide only that CLI will have three directors, that CLI is authorized to issue 300 shares, and that no shareholder may inspect CLI’s records unless that shareholder is an employee of CLI.
>
> Two years ago, CLI expanded the bowling alley to add a restaurant. The restaurant has been a big success, and its signature dish, the Two-Pound Burger, has become a local sensation. CLI subsequently opened several drive-through restaurants throughout the state serving the Two-Pound Burger. One month ago, CLI received an offer from Beef House, Inc. (“BHI”), a local fast-food chain, to purchase CLI’s entire drive-through business for $10 million. CLI’s directors convened a meeting to discuss the offer and invited Margo to attend. At the meeting, Margo expressed concern that BHI’s offering price was too low. She recommended that CLI hire an accounting firm to provide an estimate of the value of the drive-through business. Rusty, the board’s chairman, thanked Margo for her input and said that the directors would discuss the matter further.
>
> After Margo left the meeting, Rusty said to the other directors: “I don’t know what Margo is thinking. Our drive-through business is not worth $10 million – not even close. We need to accept BHI’s offer right now, before BHI realizes it has offered too much. We should vote on it right now.” Claire and Emily were never very interested in CLI’s business, and they had no idea what the drive-through business was worth. They did what Rusty suggested, and the three directors voted unanimously to accept BHI’s offer and to authorize the sale of the drive-through business to BHI. At the time the directors voted, Rusty knew that $10 million was not a fair price for the drive-through business. He also owned 40 percent of BHI’s total stock shares, which he did not disclose to Claire or Emily before the directors voted.
>
> One week after the directors voted, Margo hired an accounting firm on behalf of CLI to estimate the value of CLI’s drive-through business. She received the report just a few days ago. The report states that, on the day the directors voted to sell the drive-through business, the business was worth at least $30 million. Margo resigned from CLI the following day, but before she left, she wrote a letter to CLI’s shareholders informing them of the board’s actions and the accounting firm’s report.
>
> Once news of the pending sale broke to the public, the share price of BHI’s stock skyrocketed, just as Rusty expected it would. Abigail owns six percent of CLI’s issued shares. She inherited the shares from her grandfather one year ago. She wants to bring an action to prevent CLI’s sale of the drive-through business to BHI, and she wants to review the accounting firm’s report. CLI and BHI are planning to execute the sale in one week.

**Questions**
Please answer the following four subquestions. The subquestions in Question 1 are not
weighted equally. Explain each answer; an answer without explanation will receive no credit.

**5.1** In light of the provision in CLI’s articles of incorporation that no shareholder may inspect the company’s records unless the shareholder is an employee of CLI, does Abigail have any right to review the accounting firm’s report; and, if so, what steps must she take to exercise that right? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Look at statutory rights of shareholders to inspect corporate records and how these rights might override or be affected by the company's articles of incorporation. Also, consider the process a shareholder must follow to demand inspection.


**Answer**
Despite the provision in CLI’s articles of incorporation, Abigail may still have the right to inspect certain corporate records based on statutory laws which often guarantee shareholders the right to inspect books and records for a proper purpose. Since Abigail’s motive—to investigate a potentially undervalued sale that could harm her investment—could be considered a proper purpose, she might contest the restriction in the articles. To exercise this right, she would typically need to send a written demand to the corporation stating her purpose for inspection clearly and specifying the documents she wishes to inspect, such as the accounting firm’s report.


**5.2** What grounds, if any, does Abigail have to challenge the validity of the directors’ vote to accept BHI’s offer, and what steps, if any, can CLI’s directors take to prevent or defeat any challenge to that vote? Explain fully. (15 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Identify potential breaches of fiduciary duties and conflicts of interest. Analyze the possible legal actions available to shareholders under state law to challenge board decisions and the defenses directors might have.


**Answer**
Abigail can challenge the directors' vote based on Rusty’s significant conflict of interest (owning 40% of BHI), which he failed to disclose, and the resulting breach of fiduciary duties. To prevent or defeat a challenge, CLI’s directors could argue that the decision was made in what they believed to be CLI's best interests, though Rusty’s undisclosed conflict significantly undermines this defense. They could also potentially ratify the transaction through a disinterested director or shareholder vote, though this might not fully negate the challenge given the egregiousness of the conflict.



**5.3** What fiduciary duties do Rusty, Claire, and Emily owe as directors of CLI, and what, if any, duties did they breach by voting to accept BHI’s offer? Explain fully. (6 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Discuss the fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and good faith. Consider Rusty’s undisclosed interest in BHI and the inadequate consideration of the drive-through business's fair value.

**Answer**
Rusty, Claire, and Emily owe fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and good faith to CLI. Rusty breached the duty of loyalty by failing to disclose his ownership in BHI and by pushing for a transaction that was not in CLI’s best interest, motivated by his personal interest. Claire and Emily breached their duty of care by not adequately informing themselves before making a decision on the sale, essentially failing to act in an informed manner. All directors breached their duty to act in good faith by accepting an offer substantially below market value without proper diligence or consideration of CLI’s and its shareholders' interests.


**5.4** Solely for purposes of this question 4.4, assume the following:
    • The sale of CLI’s drive-through business to BHI has already occurred.
    • Abigail brought a derivative action for damages against Rusty, Claire, and Emily.
    • As a result of the derivative action, the court found that $10 million was not a fair price for CLI’s drive-through business; that the three directors breached their fiduciary duties to CLI by voting to accept BHI’s offer; and that CLI sustained damages from that breach.


**5.4.a** Are the three directors personally liable to pay damages to CLI? Explain fully. (7 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Assess the impact of the directors' breach of fiduciary duties on the corporation and the principles that guide the imposition of personal liability on directors for corporate loss.

**Answer**
The three directors could be personally liable to CLI for damages stemming from their breach of fiduciary duties. The court’s finding that they breached their duties by accepting an unfair offer and caused damages to CLI establishes a basis for their liability. Their actions individually and collectively led to a financial loss for CLI, making them directly responsible for compensating the corporation for the loss incurred due to their breaches of duty.


**5.4.b** Would CLI be permitted, if it chooses, to indemnify the three directors for the legal expenses they incurred in connection with the derivative proceeding? Explain fully. (7 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Consider corporate indemnification laws and the exceptions to indemnification, especially in cases of breach of fiduciary duty, and whether indemnification could apply to legal defense costs in derivative actions.

**Answer**
Generally, corporations can indemnify directors for legal expenses incurred in their capacity as directors unless the directors are found to have breached their fiduciary duties or acted in bad faith or with intentional misconduct. Given the court found that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to CLI by voting to accept BHI’s offer, CLI would typically not be permitted to indemnify the directors for their legal expenses related to defending against claims of such breaches, unless specific conditions met under state law allow for it, like if they acted in reliance on legal advice or believed in good faith that their actions were in the corporation's best interest. The specifics would depend on applicable state law and the corporation's bylaws.

### Case 6: Member Rights and LLC Land Sale Disputes
Disagreements over a land sale in a family-owned LLC highlight issues of member rights to financial records and majority rule in decision-making.


**Background**
> Andy, Bob, Carl, Daryl, and Earl are brothers and members in a member-managed Louisiana limited liability company (“LLC”) that owns several acres of land. The five brothers each own a one-fifth membership interest in the LLC. Bob maintains the financial records of the LLC in the safe at his home.
>
> A few months ago, Earl was killed in a car accident. His surviving daughter, Matilda, inherited Earl’s membership interest in the LLC. One month later, Andy invited Bob, Carl, Daryl, and Matilda to attend the meeting to discuss the future of the LLC. At the meeting, Andy called for a vote to approve the sale of LLC’s land. Andy, Bob, and Matilda voted to approve the sale of the land. Carl and Daryl voted against. The following day,
> Andy contacted a real estate broker to have the LLC’s land listed for sale.
>
> During the same meeting, immediately following the vote, Carl told Bob that he would like to review the company’s financial records during a weekday morning within the next ten business days. Bob did not respond to the request at the meeting, nor did Bob respond to an email Carl sent two days after the meeting reiterating his request to review the records.

**Questions**
Please answer the following two subquestions. The subquestions in Question 2A are not
weighted equally. Explain each answer; an answer without explanation will receive no credit.

**6.1** What, if anything, can Carl and Daryl do to prevent the sale of the LLC’s land; and, if they can, on what grounds? Explain fully. (15 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on the governance structure and decision-making provisions of the LLC, whether prescribed by the operating agreement or state law. Consider arguing from the perspective of protecting the LLC's best interests and adherence to the correct procedural standards. Examine the fiduciary duties of members in a member-managed LLC to act in good faith and in the best interest of the LLC, and how failing to adequately assess the land's value might breach these duties.

**Answer**
Carl and Daryl can challenge the sale of the LLC's land on the grounds that the decision to sell did not properly consider the best interests of the LLC and potentially failed to follow the proper decision-making process outlined in the LLC's operating agreement or the default state laws governing LLCs. If the operating agreement requires a supermajority or unanimous vote for significant actions such as selling major assets, they can argue that the vote to sell was invalid. Additionally, they could assert that the decision was made without adequate information or assessment of the land's value, which could constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties owed by each member in a member-managed LLC to act in the best interest of the company.


**6.2** What right, if any, does Carl have to review the LLC’s financial records? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Understand the importance of transparency within LLCs and review the state-specific statutory rights of LLC members to access company records. Consider the reasonable basis for Carl's request and procedural actions Carl can take to enforce his rights if initially denied access, including legal recourse.

**Answer**
Carl has a statutory right to review the LLC's financial records as a member of the LLC. Louisiana law, like many jurisdictions, allows LLC members to inspect and copy records for purposes reasonably related to their interest as a member upon reasonable request. Carl needs the financial information to participate fully and make informed decisions regarding the LLC's operations and his investment. Bob's failure to respond to Carl's request is not in compliance with these statutory provisions, and Carl may potentially seek a court order to enforce his right of inspection.



**The following applies to 6.3-6.6**

> Five years ago, Sara and Eric opened a medical diagnostic imaging center, Accurate Imaging Center (“AIC”). They operated the business as a partnership and shared equally in the profits and expenses of the business.
>
> Four months ago, while Sara and Eric were having lunch, Eric suggested that they begin upgrading some of their imaging equipment, starting with AIC’s MRI machine. Sara knew there was nothing wrong with the one machine they had, and she believed buying a new one would be a waste of money, but she did not express her concern to Eric.
>
> The following month, Eric, without informing Sara, purchased a new MRI machine for $3 million. When Sara learned of the purchase, she confronted Eric: “What were you thinking, Eric! There is nothing wrong with the MRI machine we have! How can you spend $3 million of our money on a new MRI machine that we don’t need and not even think to speak with me about it first?”
>
> Eric responded, “MRI service is a huge part of our business, and we need to have the best MRI machine available to remain competitive. Plus, if I had checked with you before I purchased it, you just would have said, no.” Sara replied, “I can’t be a partner with you in this business if that’s how you think! I quit!” To which Eric replied, “Fine! Leave! I can run this $40 million business perfectly fine without you!” Sara packed up her office and left that day.
>
> One month later, Eric signed an agreement with Parts Inc. to purchase repair parts for one of AIC’s X-ray machines. The parts cost $20,000, with payment due ten days after delivery. One week later, the X-ray repair parts were delivered to AIC. That night, AIC’s facility and all its contents, including the X-ray repair parts, were destroyed in a fire. The $20,000 balance for the X-ray repairs remains unpaid.


**6.3** Did Eric have authority to purchase the MRI machine without Sara’s consent? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Examine the principles of implied authority in partnerships and the scope of actions considered within the ordinary course of business. Assess the impact of the purchase's magnitude on the partnership's financial well-being and the necessity for joint decision-making on significant expenditures.

**Answer**
Eric may have had the implied authority to purchase the MRI machine without Sara's explicit consent if purchasing equipment falls within the ordinary course of the partnership’s business operations. However, the significant expenditure and the lack of a dire need for a new MRI machine could exceed what is considered actions within the ordinary course of business, requiring mutual decision-making. Thus, Eric's unilateral action without discussing it with Sara could be seen as exceeding his authority within the partnership.


**6.4** Did Sara properly withdraw from the partnership? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Consider the formalities involved in withdrawing from a partnership, including notification and potentially required processes for resolving the partnership's dissolution or a partner's departure, according to the partnership agreement or default statutory provisions.

**Answer**
Sara’s immediate declaration of her intent to quit in response to a dispute may not constitute a proper withdrawal from the partnership, depending on the terms outlined in their partnership agreement or default state law provisions regarding partnership dissolution. A proper withdrawal often requires formal notification and may need to follow specified procedures for disengagement and settling accounts between the partners.


**6.5** Solely for purposes of this question 2.5, assume that Sara properly withdrew from the partnership. What amount, if any, is Sara entitled to receive for her share in the partnership? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Investigate the process for valuing a withdrawing partner’s interest, including the evaluation of the partnership's assets, liabilities, and any specific terms regarding valuation in the partnership agreement or governed by state law.

**Answer**
Assuming Sara properly withdrew from the partnership, she is entitled to receive the fair value of her share in the partnership at the time of her withdrawal. This amount would likely include her portion of the partnership's profits and may also account for her contributions to the partnership less any liabilities or outstanding debts attributable to her share. The fair value would be determined based on the partnership’s financial situation immediately prior to her withdrawal.


**6.6** Solely for purposes of this question 2.6, assume that Sara did not properly withdraw from the partnership. What amount, if any, can Parts Inc. recover from Sara for the $20,000 balance owed for X-ray repair parts? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Understand the concept of joint and several liability in partnerships for obligations incurred during the ordinary business operations. Acknowledge the consequences of a partner’s failure to properly withdraw from the partnership, including continued liability for new debts.

**Answer**
Assuming Sara did not properly withdraw from the partnership, she remains liable for the partnership’s obligations, including debts incurred in the ordinary course of business. Parts Inc. can therefore recover the $20,000 balance owed for the X-ray repair parts from Sara as she is still considered a partner and responsible for the partnership's debts.

### Case 7: Shareholder Rights and Corporate Governance in Family Business
In a family-operated corporation, disputes over employment promises, shareholder rights, corporate governance, and allegations of insider benefits escalate following shifts in share distribution and corporate policy amendments.

**Background**
> Ernest Smith was a successful sugar cane farmer. He had three children: Evan, William, and Molly. Ernest employed all of them in his business. In 2002, Ernest decided to retire and to hand over his farming business to his children. That year, Ernest formed Sugar Farm, Inc. The articles of incorporation provided only the following: (1) the corporation would have three directors; (2) the directors would be elected annually by a majority vote of the shareholders; (3) the articles named Evan, William, and Molly as the initial directors; (4) an authorization for Sugar Farm to issue 300 shares of stock; and (5) the election of preemptive rights.
>
> At the first meeting of the board of directors, Evan, William, and Molly voted to appoint Evan as president, William as secretary, and Molly as treasurer. The directors also approved the issuance of Sugar Farm’s 300 authorized shares to the directors, each receiving 100 shares. Sugar Farm grew rapidly under the leadership of Ernest’s children, and as the business grew, Ernest’s children were able to employ their own children in the business. Evan, William, and Molly informally agreed that Sugar Farm would offer to each of their children, on his or her 18th birthday, full-time employment with Sugar Farm.
>
> Ten years ago, Evan discovered that Molly had embezzled $5,000 from Sugar Farm’s accounts. Evan and William voted to remove Molly as a director, and Evan terminated Molly’s employment with Sugar Farm. Evan and William did not appoint or elect a new director to replace Molly.
>
> One year ago, Molly died. She left all her shares in Sugar Farm to her only child, Elaine. Before Molly died, she told Elaine about the agreement she and her brothers had to offer full-time employment to each child in the Smith family on the child’s 18th birthday.
>
> Elaine turned 18 one month after Molly died. She wrote a letter to her uncles Evan and William asking if they would allow her to work for Sugar Farm. Evan and William were not receptive. After receiving Elaine’s letter, Evan emailed William: “Just received a letter from Molly’s kid asking for a job. I have no intention of allowing that brat to join our family business! Hope you agree.” William responded: “I agree completely! Let’s discuss a more permanent solution to keep her out of our affairs. The brat currently owns one-third of our company!” Evan and William then sent a letter to Elaine, refusing her request for employment, providing no explanation for the refusal.
>
> The following day, Evan and William convened a meeting of the board of directors and voted to approve the following resolutions: (1) to increase Sugar Farm’s authorized shares from 300 to 1,000 shares; (2) to issue 150 shares each to Evan and William, as additional compensation for their employment with Sugar Farm; (3) to issue 100 shares each to four children of Evan and William who were currently employed by Sugar Farm, as additional compensation for their employment; (4) to amend the articles of incorporation to provide that no shareholder may inspect corporate records unless the shareholder is employed by the corporation; and (5) to discontinue annual dividend payments to shareholders and to apply the funds instead to increase the salaries of Evan, William, and the four children of Evan and William currently employed by Sugar Farm.
>
> One month ago, Elaine signed and sent a letter to William requesting copies of, or access to, all written offers of employment sent by Sugar Farm to any member of the Smith family. Elaine stated in her letter that she seeks access to the requested documents in order to determine whether she was unfairly treated in being denied employment with the company. William sent a reply letter to Elaine denying her request, stating: “Although you are a shareholder of record holding more than five percent of Sugar Farm’s issued shares, and you have held those shares for more than six months, you are not currently employed by Sugar Farm and, therefore, have no right to inspect any records of the corporation.”
>
> Yesterday, Sugar Farm held its annual shareholders’ meeting at its principal office in Baton Rouge. Evan and William orally informed their children of the shareholders’ meeting but did not provide written notice of the meeting to any shareholders.
>
> Although Elaine did not receive written notice of the meeting, one of her cousins told her about the meeting. Elaine attended the meeting along with every other shareholder.
>
> At the start of the meeting, William announced that the board of directors would be proposing two amendments to the articles of incorporation for approval by the shareholders: (1) an amendment to reduce the number of directors from three to two, and (2) an amendment to add a provision that “no director or officer of Sugar Farm, Inc. shall be liable to the corporation or its shareholders for any action taken, or any failure to take action, as a director or officer.” Elaine shouted: “I was not provided written notice of this shareholders’ meeting or of the proposed amendments. I object to this meeting and any voting on the proposed amendments.” The meeting continued, and votes were taken on the proposed amendments. Elaine voted her 100 shares against the proposed amendments. The remaining shareholders voted their shares (900 shares) in favor of the proposed amendments. William then announced: “Both proposed amendments have been approved by a majority vote of the shareholders and are hereby adopted.”
>
> This morning, Elaine discovered that during the past several months, Evan and William, as directors, voted to authorize the use of corporate funds to pay for improvements made to their private residences.

**Questions**
**7.1.** What potential grounds, if any, does Elaine have for an action to invalidate the issuance of the 700 new shares to Evan, William, and their children or, alternatively, to require Sugar Farm to issue additional shares to her? What defenses might reasonably be raised, and is Elaine likely to succeed? (10 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
When analyzing this situation, consider the legal principles surrounding preemptive rights, shareholder dilution, and the fiduciary duties of directors. Look for evidence of self-dealing or breach of these duties by the directors. Also, scrutinize the articles of incorporation and any shareholder agreements for provisions regarding share issuance and preemptive rights.

**Answer**
Elaine could potentially challenge the issuance of the 700 new shares on the grounds of (1) dilution of her shareholder interest, (2) breach of fiduciary duty by Evan and William, (3) violation of preemptive rights, and (4) improper use of corporate assets for personal benefit. The main defenses that might be raised by Evan and William could include (1) the issuance of shares was within their authority as directors, (2) the action was in the best interest of the company for retaining and rewarding key employees, and (3) Elaine was not entitled to receive additional shares under the company’s articles of incorporation or bylaws. However, Elaine's challenge could be successful, especially if she can prove that the share issuance was a self-dealing action that unfairly diluted her ownership percentage and that it was done without proper notice or consideration of shareholders' preemptive rights.


**7.2.** What rights, if any, does Elaine have to inspect Sugar Farm’s corporate records? What steps, if any, must she take to obtain access to any written offers of employment sent by Sugar Farm to members of the Smith family? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on the statutory basis for shareholder inspection rights, the definition of a "proper purpose", and the procedure for making a demand for inspection. Consider how amendments to corporate governance documents can affect these rights but also how they can conflict with statutory provisions.

**Answer**
Elaine has a statutory right to inspect Sugar Farm’s corporate records as a shareholder. The recent amendment limiting inspection rights to employees potentially violates state law provisions that grant shareholders the general right to inspect records for a proper purpose. Elaine's desire to examine employment offers sent to family members to assess if she was unfairly denied employment constitutes a proper purpose. To obtain access, she would typically need to make a written demand stating this purpose. Given the refusal she already received, her next steps may involve legal action to enforce her right of inspection. The defenses against her inspection rights, like the corporate amendment, are unlikely to hold if they conflict with state law granting such rights.


**7.3.** Can Elaine bring an action to compel Evan and William to reimburse Sugar Farm for payments made for improvements to their private residences? Discuss fully what type of action(s); the requirements of any such action(s); and the likelihood of success of such action(s) that Elaine might bring and any defenses that Evan, William, or any other party might assert to any such action(s). (10 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Understand the criteria and process for bringing a derivative action. Assess both the evidence of misuse of corporate assets and the legal justification (or lack thereof) for such use.

**Answer**
Elaine can bring a derivative action on behalf of Sugar Farm to compel Evan and William to reimburse the corporation for unauthorized payments used for personal benefits, such as improvements to their private residences. A derivative action requires Elaine to demonstrate she is a shareholder, that she tried to resolve the issue with the board or shareholders (or explain why such an effort would be futile), and that her claim is on behalf of the corporation. Given the apparent misuse of corporate funds, Elaine's likelihood of success seems high, provided she can prove the payments did not serve a legitimate corporate purpose. The main defenses might assert that the expenditures were somehow in the corporation's best interest or compensated for undervalued services. However, given the personal nature of the expenses, these defenses may not hold.



**7.4.** What action(s), if any, can Elaine bring to compel Sugar Farm to purchase her shares? What must Elaine establish to obtain that relief, and is she likely to succeed? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Explore the concept of shareholder oppression and the rights of minority shareholders within a corporation. Focus on the expectations set forth by shareholder agreements or the corporation's history and how deviations from these may constitute oppressive actions.

**Answer**
Elaine may seek to compel Sugar Farm to purchase her shares under an action for oppression, arguing that the actions of Evan and William, as majority shareholders and directors, were oppressive to her as a minority shareholder. She would need to establish that the conduct of the majority shareholders was contrary to the standards of fair dealing and violated her reasonable expectations as a shareholder. Given the dilution of her shares, refusal of employment, decrease in dividend payments, and restrictions on her shareholder rights without proper notice or fairness, Elaine may have a strong case. Success would depend on demonstrating the oppressive nature of the majority's actions and how they negatively impacted her rights and interests.



**7.5.** On what grounds may Elaine seek to invalidate the amendment approved by the shareholders reducing the number of directors from three to two, and is she likely to succeed? Explain fully. (10 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on the procedural requirements for amending articles of incorporation and conducting shareholders' meetings, especially regarding notice requirements. Assess the intent and impact of the amendments to determine their fairness and legality within the framework of corporate governance laws.

**Answer**
Elaine may seek to invalidate the amendment reducing the number of directors from three to two on the grounds that she was not provided written notice of the amendments or the shareholders' meeting as required by law, thereby invalidating the vote on the amendment. Furthermore, she could argue that the amendment is an attempt by Evan and William to further entrench their control over the corporation, potentially to her detriment. Success in this challenge would likely hinge on demonstrating the procedural flaws in how the meeting and vote were conducted, particularly the failure to provide adequate notice to all shareholders. Considering these factors, Elaine's challenge has a strong basis and may well be successful if it can be shown that the procedural and substantive fairness standards were not met.

### Case 8: Formation Failures and Liability in a Brewing Venture
A brewing venture between friends goes awry due to unfiled business formation documents, leading to disaster and potential personal liability for equipment and property losses.

**Background**

> Claire, Andrew, and Rusty are avid homebrewers. They decided to go into business together and open a brewery. They agreed that they would share equally in the profits and losses of the business and that they would conduct the business as a limited liability company. They agreed to call the company Swamp Juice.
>
> Claire, Andrew, and Rusty prepared and signed articles of organization and an initial report. Andrew told the others he would file the documents with the Secretary of State’s office that day, but it slipped his mind, and he never filed the documents.
>
> The following day, Claire informed Andrew and Rusty that a local brewery, Bad Beer, Inc., was going out of business and was seeking a buyer for its brewery equipment. The three agreed that Swamp Juice needed brewery equipment and that Claire should purchase Bad Beer, Inc.’s brewery equipment.
>
> Claire contacted Bad Beer, Inc. and agreed to purchase the brewery equipment for $50,000. Claire did not inform Bad Beer, Inc. that she was purchasing the equipment for Swamp Juice, and she signed a purchase agreement as “Claire.” The purchase agreement required payment in full within one month of delivery.
>
> Later that same day, Rusty was driving through town looking for a suitable location for Swamp Juice’s brewery. He spotted a vacant warehouse and contacted the owner. The owner offered to sell the warehouse for $40,000. Rusty called Claire and Andrew and informed them of the warehouse and the offer. Claire and Andrew were pleased with the amount of the offer, but they told Rusty not to accept the offer until they had a chance to visit the warehouse with him. The warehouse owner overheard Rusty’s conservation with Claire and Andrew. After the call, the warehouse owner said to Rusty: “I know your buddies want to see the warehouse first, but if you accept my offer right now, I’ll agree to finance the entire purchase price.” Rusty accepted the offer. He and the owner proceeded to a nearby notary’s office and executed an act of sale and a $40,000 promissory note. Rusty signed each of the documents as “Swamp Juice, through Rusty, its representative.”
>
> One week later, the brewery equipment was delivered to the warehouse. Claire, Andrew, and Rusty began assembling the equipment in preparation for their first brew. The following day, a boiler tank collapsed, spilling hundreds of gallons of boiling fluid onto the warehouse floor. In the chaos of the accident, Rusty forgot to turn off the gas supply to the boiler. The warehouse caught fire that evening. The warehouse and all of its contents were destroyed in the fire. No payments have been made to date on either the purchase agreement with Bad Beer, Inc. or the $40,000 promissory note.

**Questions**
**8.1.** Who is liable to Bad Beer, Inc. for the purchase price of the brewery equipment? Explain fully. (12 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Consider the legal implications of conducting business or signing contracts on behalf of an entity that has not been validly formed. Focus on the significance of filing the necessary documents to establish an LLC and understand how acting without proper authority or before an entity’s formation can lead to personal liability.


**Answer**
Claire is personally liable to Bad Beer, Inc. for the purchase price of the brewery equipment. Since she signed the purchase agreement in her name without mentioning her intent to act on behalf of Swamp Juice or its Members, and because Swamp Juice had not been properly formed as an LLC due to the failure to file the necessary documents, Claire acted in her personal capacity. The law does not recognize Swamp Juice as a separate legal entity because the articles of organization were never filed. Consequently, the liability falls on Claire personally, rather than on the intended but unformed LLC.


**8.2.** Who is liable on the $40,000 promissory note for the purchase of the warehouse? Explain fully. (12 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Explore the concept of personal accountability when engaging in transactions on behalf of a non-existent or unformed entity. Acknowledge how apparent authority and reliance play a role in determining liability when one acts as a representative of an LLC or corporation that has not been properly established.

**Answer**
Rusty is personally liable on the $40,000 promissory note for the purchase of the warehouse. Despite signing "Swamp Juice, through Rusty, its representative," the LLC was not officially formed at the time of the transaction because the articles of organization were not filed. As a result, there was no legal entity of Swamp Juice to take on the liability. Additionally, the warehouse owner's decision to move forward based on Rusty's unilateral acceptance can be seen as reliance on Rusty's apparent authority to act. Thus, the liability for the promissory note falls on Rusty for acting on behalf of an unformed LLC.



**8.3.** What are “emergency powers” for a Louisiana corporation, and how are such powers used? (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Understand the statutory basis for the use of emergency powers by corporate boards or officers in Louisiana, including the types of situations that qualify as emergencies and the scope of actions that can be undertaken under such powers.

**Answer**
“Emergency powers” for a Louisiana corporation refer to special powers granted to the corporation's board of directors or, in some cases, to its officers, to take certain actions that would normally require shareholder approval when it is not practicable to obtain such approval due to an emergency situation. These powers are intended for use during catastrophic events that prevent the corporation from conducting business as usual, such as natural disasters or other situations that disrupt normal operations. The specific actions that can be taken under emergency powers are typically detailed in the corporation’s bylaws or relevant state statutes, allowing the directors/officers to ensure the continuity of the corporation's operations.


**8.4.** What is a “unanimous governance agreement” for a Louisiana corporation? (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Delve into the flexibility offered by Louisiana law for corporate governance through unanimous governance agreements, including the requirements for such agreements and the extent to which they can modify the corporation’s governance structure.

**Answer**
A “unanimous governance agreement” for a Louisiana corporation is a written agreement among all of the shareholders that can alter the traditional corporate governance structure. Through this agreement, shareholders can decide to modify or eliminate the board of directors’ role, transfer board or corporate powers to a shareholder or shareholders, or provide for a different means of making corporate decisions that would typically require board or shareholder meetings and votes. This agreement allows for flexibility in corporate governance, particularly in closely held corporations where the shareholders wish to have direct control over business decisions.



**8.5.** Can shareholders of a Louisiana corporation unilaterally remove a director, and, if so, under what circumstances? (6 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on the procedural aspects of director removal as outlined in the corporation's bylaws and articles of incorporation, including any specific requirements or limitations placed on the shareholders' ability to remove directors.

**Answer**
Yes, shareholders of a Louisiana corporation can unilaterally remove a director, but the circumstances under which this can happen are typically specified in the corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws. Generally, directors can be removed by a vote of the shareholders, with or without cause, depending on the provisions of the corporation’s governing documents. If the corporation’s bylaws or articles of incorporation stipulate that directors can only be removed with cause, then the shareholders must provide a valid reason for the removal. If the governing documents do not require cause, then directors can be removed by shareholder vote without needing to specify the reason.

### Case 9: Formation and Management of Business Entities in Louisiana
The creation and operational structure of corporations and LLCs, authority and actions of members or shareholders, and implications of withdrawal from or changes within a business entity are critically examined through hypothetical scenarios in Louisiana.

**Background**
Part A – 20 POINTS (5 points each subpart)
Questions 9.1-9.4 are based on the following facts:

> Allison, Billy and Clayton want to form a Louisiana corporation to sell college football championship apparel. They will name their business “ABC, Inc.” and initially issue 350 shares of stock. Allison will own 150 shares, Billy will own 100 shares, and Clayton will own 100 shares. ABC, Inc. will also be authorized to issue an additional 150 shares. All shares will be without par value.
>
> Billy and Clayton will run the day-to-day business, and Allison will be a silent investor with no managerial responsibilities. Allison, Billy and Clayton want the right to maintain their respective ownership percentages in the event ABC, Inc. decides to sell the authorized, but unissued 150 shares. They also want a right of first refusal to purchase each other’s shares in the event a shareholder decides to sell his or her shares. Finally, they want to require that any new prospective shareholder be approved by a majority vote of the current shareholders.

**9.1**
**9.1.a** What organizational papers are necessary to form ABC, Inc. as a Louisiana corporation?

**Tips & Analysis**
Familiarize yourself with the basic requirements and documents for forming a corporation in Louisiana. Understand that the Articles of Incorporation is the primary document that officially establishes a corporation in the state.

**Answer**
To form ABC, Inc. as a Louisiana corporation, the necessary organizational papers are the Articles of Incorporation which need to be prepared and filed with the Louisiana Secretary of State’s office.


**9.1.b** What minimum information must be included in these papers to validly form ABC, Inc.?

**Tips & Analysis**
Delve into the specific details that are legally required in the Articles of Incorporation for a corporation in Louisiana. Knowing these details ensures compliance and valid formation of the corporation.

**Answer**
The minimum information that must be included in the Articles of Incorporation to validly form ABC, Inc. includes the corporation's name, the number of shares the corporation is authorized to issue, the address of the corporation's initial registered office, the name of its initial registered agent at that office, and the names and addresses of the initial directors.


**9.1.c** What, if any, additional provisions are required to achieve the objectives as stated above?
**Tips & Analysis**
Consider how additional provisions in the Articles of Incorporation or the corporation’s Bylaws can tailor the governance of the corporation to the specific needs and desires of its founders. Be specific in drafting to ensure objectives are clearly achievable under the corporation’s governing documents.

**Answer**
To achieve the objectives as stated above, the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws should contain specifics on preemptive rights to maintain ownership percentages, a right of first refusal for purchasing each other’s shares, and the requirement for new shareholders to be approved by a majority vote of the current shareholders.



**9.2**

**9.2.a** Is ABC, Inc. required to issue certificates of stock representing the shares to be issued? Explain.

**Tips & Analysis**
Understand the flexibility provided under Louisiana law regarding the issuance of stock certificates. Certificates are traditional, but not mandatory, and companies can opt for electronic or other forms to represent ownership.

**Answer**
No, ABC, Inc. is not required to issue certificates of stock representing the shares, although it may choose to do so. Louisiana law allows for both certificated and uncertificated shares.

**9.2.b** If ABC, Inc. issues certificates of stock, what information is to be shown on each share certificate?

**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on the standard requirements for stock certificates. This ensures that all necessary information is presented clearly to reflect ownership accurately.

**Answer**
 If ABC, Inc. issues certificates of stock, each share certificate must show the name of the issuing corporation, the name of the person to whom issued, the number and class of shares, and the designation of the series, if any.


**9.2.c** If ABC, Inc. does not issue stock certificates, will this change the rights and obligations Allison, Billy or Clayton owe to ABC, Inc.? Explain.

**Tips & Analysis**
Understand that the issuance of stock certificates is a formal acknowledgment of share ownership but does not in itself define the rights and obligations of the shareholders.

**Answer**
No, not issuing stock certificates will not change the rights and obligations Allison, Billy, or Clayton owe to ABC, Inc. Their rights as shareholders and obligations towards the corporation remain the same, irrespective of the physical issuance of certificates.


**9.3**
**9.3.a** Does the law require that any of Allison, Billy and Clayton be an officer or director of ABC, Inc.? Explain.

**Tips & Analysis**
Recognize the distinction between shareholders and corporate officers or directors in a corporation’s structure. Shareholders may choose to take on these roles but are not legally obliged to.

**Answer**
The law does not specifically require any of Allison, Billy, and Clayton to be an officer or director of ABC, Inc. Officers and directors can be elected or appointed according to the corporation's bylaws.


**9.3.b** What officer positions (if any) must they elect?

**Tips & Analysis**
Note the common officer titles and roles within a corporation but also remember that the corporation has flexibility in defining specific roles within its bylaws.

**Answer**
They must elect positions typically recognized in corporate governance, such as President, Secretary, and Treasurer, although specific positions can vary based on the corporation's bylaws.



**9.3.c** May Billy hold more than one officer position at one time? Explain.

**Tips & Analysis**
Be aware of the flexibility in roles and responsibilities within a corporation, particularly in smaller entities where officers often wear multiple hats.

**Answer**
Yes, Billy can hold more than one officer position at one time, if allowed by the corporation's bylaws. This is a common practice, especially in smaller corporations.


**9.3.d** Does the law require that the officers also be directors? Explain.

**Tips & Analysis**
Understand the separation of roles within a corporation that allows individuals to be either directors, officers, both, or neither, depending on the corporation's governance structure.

**Answer**
No, the law does not require that officers also be directors, though they can be. This allows for flexibility in how the corporation is structured and operated.


**9.3.e** What is the difference between straight voting and cumulative voting for director positions?

**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on the differences in voting rights and procedures, particularly how they can affect the power dynamics in electing directors.

**Answer**
Straight voting is where each shareholder votes the number of shares they own for each director position. Cumulative voting allows shareholders to allocate their total votes (shares times director positions) in any combination they choose among the candidates.


**9.3.f** When will shareholders have cumulative voting rights?

**Tips & Analysis**
Pay attention to the provisions within the Articles of Incorporation that can grant shareholders cumulative voting rights, understanding its implications for governance and shareholder influence.

**Answer**
Shareholders have cumulative voting rights if the corporation’s Articles of Incorporation specifically allow for it. Cumulative voting is not mandatory and must be expressly adopted.


**9.4** Assume that Allison, Billy and Clayton want to form a Louisiana limited liability company (LLC) instead of a corporation for their proposed venture. To achieve the objectives stated above, should the LLC be formed as a member-managed LLC or instead as a manager-managed LLC? Explain the difference between these two forms of LLC.

**Tips & Analysis**
Distinguish between member-managed and manager-managed LLCs in terms of control and operation. Consider the founders' intentions for their roles within the LLC when making this decision.

**Answer**
To achieve the objectives stated, the LLC should be formed as a member-managed LLC since Allison wishes to be a silent investor while Billy and Clayton run the day-to-day business. In a member-managed LLC, all members can participate in management, but the operating agreement can limit their roles, allowing Billy and Clayton to actively manage the business, while Allison remains a passive investor. A manager-managed LLC would centralize management in one or more managers, who may or may not be members, which is not necessary given the desired structure.




**Questions 9.5-9.8 are based on the following facts:**

> Three radiologists—Amanda, Jack, and Matthew—opened a radiology practice together six years ago. They agreed to call their business “X-Ray Mart,” to divide the profits equally, and to run the practice together in a manner that would be competitive. Toward that end, they purchased state-of-the-art radiology imaging equipment comparable to that of other radiology offices in the community.
>
> Shortly after opening the practice, Amanda, Jack, and Matthew retained an attorney to organize the practice as a limited liability company. The attorney prepared the appropriate articles of organization and the initial report and forwarded the documents to Amanda, Jack, and Matthew for signature. They each signed and dated the documents; however, they were so involved in their radiology practice that they did not send the documents to the attorney or anyone else. A month ago, Amanda suggested to Jack and Matthew that the practice replace some of the imaging equipment. Jack was worried about overspending on imaging equipment, but he did not express his concern to Amanda and Matthew.
>
> A week ago, Amanda, without discussing the matter further with either Jack or Matthew, purchased for the office a $400,000 state-of-the-art digital x-ray machine like those recently acquired by other radiology offices in the community.
>
> Yesterday, after the purchase but prior to delivery, Jack learned what Amanda had done and was furious. Jack did not believe the practice could afford such an expensive machine. When Jack confronted Amanda, Amanda said, “Too bad, it’s a done deal—get over it.” At that, Jack responded, “That’s it. I’ve had enough. This machine was purchased without my consent. It’s a terrible idea. I’m out of here and never coming back. Just give me my share of the value of the practice.” Worried that Jack’s withdrawal would jeopardize critical contract negotiations that the practice needed to finalize with certain insurance companies, Amanda asked Jack to reconsider. But Jack replied, “Nope. My mind is made up.”

**9.5** What type of business entity is X-Ray Mart? Explain fully. (5 Points)
**Tips & Analysis**
This question requires recognizing the distinction between the intent to form an LLC and the actual, effective formation of one. An essential step in the LLC formation process is filing the articles of organization with the state. Failing to do so means the business defaults to a general partnership if multiple individuals are involved. In answering, focus on the steps taken (or not taken) and the legal implications of forming a business entity in Louisiana.

**Answer**
X-Ray Mart is a partnership since it was formed by Amanda, Jack, and Matthew with the intention to operate a radiology practice together, sharing profits equally without forming a different business entity. Despite their intention to organize as a limited liability company (LLC) by preparing the appropriate documents, they failed to complete the formation process by not submitting the signed documents. Therefore, by default, under Louisiana law, their business operates as a partnership due to their actions and agreements in conducting business together.



**9.6** Did Amanda have the authority to purchase the imaging machine; and if so, were there any actions that Jack and Matthew could have taken to revoke or limit her authority?  Explain fully. (5 Points)
**Tips & Analysis**
When analyzing this scenario, consider the general principles of partnership law, specifically the authority of partners to bind the partnership and the mechanisms for limiting this authority. Highlighting the importance of written agreements among partners to clearly define their rights, responsibilities, and limitations on authority can also provide a road map for how similar situations might be avoided in the future.

**Answer**
 Yes, Amanda likely had the authority to purchase the imaging machine under the partnership arrangement, given that partners in a general partnership typically have the authority to make decisions in the ordinary course of business unless otherwise agreed. There’s an implicit assumption that each partner can bind the partnership to business transactions. However, Jack and Matthew could have taken steps to limit Amanda's authority by formally agreeing (preferably in writing) on a different management structure for the partnership that requires major decisions, like significant equipment purchases, to be approved by all partners or setting a financial limit beyond which partner consent is needed before making purchases.



**9.7** Did Jack’s statements to Amanda constitute an effective withdrawal from X-Ray Mart? Explain fully.  (5 Points)
**Tips & Analysis**
To analyze this question, consider the default rules for partnership withdrawal and how a partner’s explicit statements and actions can signal withdrawal intent. Focus on the importance of a partnership agreement in detailing the process and consequences of withdrawal, if different from the state law defaults.

**Answer**
Jack’s statements could constitute an effective withdrawal from the partnership, depending on the partnership agreement terms, if any, and the default state laws governing partnerships. In Louisiana, unless there's an agreement stating otherwise, a partner can withdraw from the partnership at will. Jack’s explicit statement of intending to leave and "never coming back," coupled with a demand for his share of the practice's value, indicates a clear intent to withdraw from the partnership, likely making his withdrawal effective immediately upon his declaration.




**9.8** Assume for this question 1.8 that Jack’s withdrawal from X-Ray Mart was effective. What, if anything, should he be entitled to from X-Ray Mart, and who would be obligated to pay it? Explain fully.  (5 Points)
**Tips & Analysis**
 The answer hinges on understanding the rights of a withdrawing partner under general partnership principles, absent a formal agreement that specifies otherwise. Emphasize the calculation of a partner’s share based on the partnership’s current value and the procedures for settling a departing partner's share. Discussing potential agreements between remaining partners to buy out the withdrawing partner's interest showcases an understanding of practical solutions outside of liquidation.

**Answer**
Assuming Jack's withdrawal from X-Ray Mart was effective, he would generally be entitled to the fair value of his share of the partnership at the time of his withdrawal. This includes his portion of the partnership's assets minus liabilities, adjusted for any specific provisions in a partnership agreement, if any. Since they operated without formally filing as an LLC and likely had no written partnership agreement detailing a different withdrawal outcome, the obligation to pay Jack would lie with the partnership itself, which may require liquidation of assets to satisfy his entitlement. Alternatively, Amanda and Matthew could agree to pay Jack his share to keep the practice running, essentially buying out his interest.

### Case 10: Shareholder Rights and Director Conflicts in Corporate Investments
A corporation's controversial investment decision, influenced by a director's undisclosed personal interest, leads to significant financial losses and shareholder value decrease, highlighting issues of conflict of interest and shareholder input in corporate governance.

**Background**

> Helios, Inc. (Helios), a Louisiana corporation, was formed in 2018. Helios’s certificate of incorporation states that its purpose is “to manufacture or market solar cells and panels, and no other purpose.” Helios’s shares are publicly traded.
>
> Donna purchased shares in Helios in January 2019. Two months later, Helios’s board of directors properly called a directors’ meeting to consider whether Helios would invest $500,000 in a Utah lithium ion battery manufacturer. Although not a director of Helios, Donna appeared at the directors’ meeting to object to the proposed investment. Over Donna’s objections, Helios’s board of directors voted unanimously to invest in the lithium ion battery manufacturer. Two days after the approval, it became public knowledge that the chairman of Helios’s board of directors partially owned the battery manufacturer.
>
> Two weeks after the board of directors’ approval, Helios wired $500,000 to complete the investment in the lithium ion battery manufacturer. Since then, the value of Helios’s investment in the battery manufacturer has fallen to zero, which caused the value of Helios’s shares to drop by one-half of what it was when Donna acquired her shares in Helios.

**Questions**
**10.1** At the time of the board meeting, what actions might Donna have taken to prevent Helios from investing in the battery manufacturer; and for each such action is she likely to succeed? Explain fully. (10 Points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on understanding the practical steps a shareholder, who is not a board member, can take when disagreeing with a board decision. Consider the importance of conflict of interest disclosures and how shareholder activism might influence corporate governance, albeit with limitations on direct interventions in board decisions.

**Answer**
At the time of the board meeting, Donna had limited options as a shareholder to directly prevent Helios from investing in the battery manufacturer, especially since she was not a director. She could have (1) expressed her concerns to the board, emphasizing the potential conflict of interest and the risk to shareholders' value, which she did; (2) sought an injunction from a court to temporarily halt the investment pending a thorough investigation of the conflict of interest, although this would require immediate legal action and is not guaranteed to succeed; and (3) rallied other shareholders to put collective pressure on the board to reconsider the decision. Success in these actions would depend heavily on the timing, the board's willingness to reconsider their decision, and Donna's ability to effectively mobilize legal or shareholder support quickly. The likelihood of success is low, particularly given her status as a non-director and the limited timeframe.




**10.2** What actions, if any, should Donna take to recover her losses in her Helios stock? Explain fully, including the basis for any action and any procedural requirements. (10 Points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Analyze the fiduciary duties of directors and the rights of shareholders to challenge breaches of these duties. Emphasize the distinction between derivative and direct actions and the procedural hurdles involved, especially the requirements for standing and pre-suit demand.

**Answer**
To recover her losses, Donna could (1) file a derivative lawsuit on behalf of Helios against the board of directors for breach of fiduciary duty, specifically the duty of loyalty, given the undisclosed personal interest of the chairman in the battery manufacturer. This lawsuit would aim to hold the directors personally liable for the loss in value due to their conflicted decision-making. Procedural requirements include demonstrating standing as a shareholder at the time of the transaction, making a demand on the board to rectify the issue, or showing why such demand would be futile; and (2) potentially pursue a direct suit for securities fraud if there was misleading or inadequate disclosure to shareholders about the investment and the conflict of interest, although this case would be more complex and would require significant evidence of deceit or omission in communications to shareholders.



**10.3** Assume that Donna sold all of her shares of Helios, Inc. to Carol the day after the board approved Helios’s investment in the battery manufacturer.
**10.3.a** What action, if any, might Carol have taken to block the battery manufacturer investment? (5 Points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Understand the constraints on shareholders who inherit issues from decisions made prior to their ownership, and the narrow window for action in situations where board decisions are rapidly executed.

**Answer**
Prior to the completion of the investment transaction but after becoming a shareholder, Carol might have attempted to (1) convince the board to rescind their decision based on the conflict of interest disclosed after their vote, and (2) sought legal remedy to delay or stop the investment pending a review of the conflict of interest and its potential impact on shareholder value. However, given the quick timeline between approval and completion of the investment, and considering she was not a shareholder at the time of the decision, Carol's ability to block the investment would be extremely limited.


**10.3.b** What action, if any, might Carol take to recover her losses in her Helios stock? Explain fully. (5 Points)
**Tips & Analysis**
Focus on legal strategies to address losses due to directors' breaches of duty, considering the timing of share ownership in relation to the corporate actions challenged.
