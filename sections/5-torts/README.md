# Louisiana Bar Exam Study Guide: Torts Section

Prepared to aid in studying for the Torts section of the Louisiana Bar, this guide incorporates detailed content structured for improved comprehension, suitability for dyslexic learners, and overall study effectiveness.

## Intent for Intentional Torts
- **Intent is a crucial factor** for all intentional torts. It is established either when the offender desires the consequences of their actions or when they know the consequences are substantially certain to result from their act.

## Trespass
- **Land**: Trespass to land requires the defendant to have the purpose or substantial certainty of entering the property of another. Physical entry onto another's land fulfills the act requirement.
- **Chattel**: For trespass to chattel, the offender must intend to interfere with the owner’s dominion or use and enjoyment of their property. Damages focus on the level of dominion asserted or damage done.
- **Conversion**: Conversion concerns depriving the owner of their chattel, with damages equating to the chattel's full value, unlike trespass to chattel where damages are lesser.

## Negligence
Louisiana adopts the duty-risk formulation to approach negligence, necessitating the plaintiff to demonstrate five elements:
1. **Cause-in-Fact**
2. **Duty** - The obligation to conform to a specific standard of conduct for the protection of others against unreasonable risks.
3. **Scope of the Duty** - Assesses the foreseeability of harm and whether the defendant should be held liable.
4. **Breach of Duty** - The defendant's conduct falls below the required standard, often analyzed via the "B<PL" formula (Burden < Probability x Loss).
5. **Injury** - Actual damages must be demonstrable.

### Special Concerns in Negligence
- **NIED (Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress)**: Emotional distress without accompanying physical injury, predominantly applicable in bystander scenarios.
- **Traditional Duty** - Emphasizes the reasonable person standard.
- **Controlling Third Parties** - Outlines scenarios where one might be liable for third-party actions.

## Battery and Assault
- **Battery**: Defined as intentional harmful or offensive contact, requiting either purposeful or substantially certain knowledge of such an outcome.
- **Assault**: Involves the creation of a reasonable apprehension in the victim of an imminent harmful or offensive contact, with an emphasis on immediate threat perception rather than actual fear.

## Defamation
- **Key Elements** include a false statement presented as fact, publication to a third party, fault amounting to at least negligence, and harm caused to the plaintiff’s reputation.
- **Defenses**: Truth serves as an absolute defense.

## False Imprisonment and Invasion of Privacy
- **False Imprisonment**: The intentional confinement within fixed boundaries, without reasonable means of escape.
- **Invasion of Privacy** encompasses four types: Intrusion Upon Seclusion, Appropriation of Name or Likeness, Public Disclosure of Private Facts, and False Light.

## Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)
- Defined by intent to cause severe emotional distress or recklessness in causing such distress, the conduct must be extreme and unbearable for a civilized society.

## Defenses to Intentional Torts
- Includes consent, self-defense, defense of others, and the defense of property. Reasonableness of the force used is a consistent consideration.

## Strict Liability
- **Applies** to owners or custodians of animals, things, and buildings under certain conditions, emphasizing the lack of necessity to prove fault for damage caused.

## Vicarious Liability
- Attributes liability to employers for acts of their employees within the scope of employment, including specific scenarios and defenses related to control and conduct.

## Damages
- **Types**: Nominal, compensatory (including general, special, and hedonic damages), and punitive damages, with specific applicability and restrictions under Louisiana law.

## Medical Malpractice
- Outlines the distinction between regular providers and Qualified Healthcare Providers (QHCP), along with associated liabilities, defenses, and procedural nuances.

## Louisiana Products Liability Act (LPLA)
- **Establishes** exclusive remedies against manufacturers for damage caused by defective products, setting forth definitions, standards, and defenses within the product liability domain.

## Wrongful Death and Survival
- Addresses the legal pathways for recovery by designated beneficiaries of a deceased victim, distinguishing between survival actions and wrongful death claims with an emphasis on distinct damages recoverable under each.

## Prescription
- **Defines** the limitations period for initiating lawsuits, detailing exceptions that may extend the standard one-year prescriptive period under specific circumstances.
