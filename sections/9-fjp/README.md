# Federal Jurisdiction and Procedure: The Fashionably Legal Guide

Imagine the world of law as an exclusive party where not everyone gets an invite. It's about navigating through the velvet ropes (jurisdictional boundaries) and choosing the perfect outfit (claims) for the occasion. Let's break down the complex world of Federal Jurisdiction and Procedure with a touch of couture, making it an enjoyable read for the style-savvy fashion merchandising major.

## The Invite List: Subject Matter Jurisdiction (SMJ)
Just like the hottest parties have a strict guest list, federal courts only entertain cases specifically invited by the Constitution or Congress. Think of **SMJ** as the bouncer checking if you're on the list. If you're representing a glam clash of states (complete diversity) or dealing with a designer dispute over $75,000, congratulations, you've made the cut.

## Dress Code: State Law vs. Federal Law
Dressing appropriately for an event is crucial. In the legal party, this means distinguishing between **state law** and **federal law**. Thanks to the Erie doctrine, when in a federal court using diversity jurisdiction, you must dress (argue) in the state law applicable to the case, maintaining that state vs. runway-ready balance.

## VIP Section: Non-Corp. State Citizenship
For non-corporate entities like your favorite indie fashion brands, their place at the party (state citizenship) depends on the members' fashion capitals (state citizenships) - think Paris, Milan, or New York.

## The Theme: 1331 Fed Question
Some parties have themes. In the federal court, the party theme is "Federal Question" under 1331, focusing solely on disputes over the latest federal regulations on sustainable fashion or trademark disputes over iconic designs.

## At the Door: Defects in SMJ
Even with an invite, guests can be turned away at the door for breaking the dress code (SMJ defects). It's a fashion faux pas with legal consequences, leading to a dismissal of the case, no matter how far the night has progressed.

## Mixing Patterns: State Law v. Fed Law: Procedure Conflict
Sometimes, mixing patterns (state procedural laws vs. federal procedural laws) is a bold move but doesn't always work. In the federal party, when there's a clash, the federal procedural law wins, ensuring everyone stays on theme.

## The Accessory Rule: Claim Joinder Rule 18
Like accessorizing your outfit, Rule 18 lets you add as many unrelated claims as you want against an opponent, making for a bold legal statement.

## The Ensemble: Permissive Party Joinder Under Rule 20
Just as a group in matching outfits can make a statement, plaintiffs or defendants can join forces in one suit if their claims share the same transaction or occurrence. It’s essentially coordinating outfits for a group entrance.

## The Changing Room: Diversity at Filing
Fashion changes rapidly, but the diversity status at the time of filing your claim is your outfit for the night. Make sure it’s perfect because changing it later won’t affect the court's view (SMJ validity).

## Who Wore It Best: People State Citizenship
Deciding your fashion capital (state citizenship) isn't just about where you last shopped (physical presence) but where you plan to set your roots and strut your style (intent to remain indefinitely).

## Statement Pieces: Measuring JA
Your claim must be worth the show (exceed $75,000). It’s about proving that your legal outfit (damages) isn’t just ready-to-wear but couture-level expensive.

## The Exclusive Party: Required Party Joinder Under Rule 19
Some parties require an exclusive guest list. If missing a crucial person (required party) would spoil the party (lawsuit), try to invite them. If they can't make it without ruining the venue’s vibe (SMJ), the court decides if the party goes on without them.

## Designer Citizenship: Corp. State Citizenship
Corporations, like high-end designers, have their main fashion houses (principal place of business) and their incorporation places. They bring the essence of their brand identity into the legal realm, defining their state citizenship.
