# Civil Code III
Civil Code III encompasses essential aspects of the Louisiana Civil Code and related Ancillaries, focusing on obligations, conventional obligations or contracts, sales, exchange, leases, mandates, deposit, compromises, and a wide array of security rights such as mortgages, pledges, suretyships, and more. It also delves into liberative prescription, the Uniform Commercial Code - Secured Transactions, and conflict of laws pertaining to Civil Code Articles 3537 through 3541, excluding specific matters designated for the Torts examination and laws concerning partnership and representation.

## Flash Facts
- **Mortgages and Promissory Notes:** Understanding the formal requirements for the execution, witness, and notarization of mortgages and promissory notes is crucial. Incorrect or incomplete execution can affect enforceability.

- **Suretyships and Guarantees:** A personal guarantee or suretyship requires clear, formal documentation to be enforceable. Oral assurances often lack the legal basis for enforcement.

- **Lease Agreements and Modifications:** Any modifications to lease terms must be mutually agreed upon and documented. Unilateral changes without express consent from both parties may not be legally binding.

- **Public Records Doctrine:** This doctrine plays a vital role in determining the enforceability of leases and mortgages against third parties. Proper recording provides notice which is fundamental for enforceability.

- **Right of First Refusal:** This contractual right allows its holder the option to enter into a business transaction with the property owner before others. Proper execution, recording, and adherence to agreed terms are essential.

- **Prescription Periods for Debts:** Debts are subject to statutes of limitations, known as prescription periods, after which they become unenforceable. Actions taken by creditors can affect these periods.

- **Lesion Beyond Moiety:** This concept applies to situations where a sale price is significantly below the property's fair market value, providing grounds for rescission.


## Preparation and Application
To effectively prepare for Civil Code III questions, focus on:
- **Understanding Core Concepts:** Grasp the foundational principles governing contracts, obligations, and property rights under Louisiana law.

- **Application to Hypothetical Scenarios:** Practice applying these principles to hypothetical situations, akin to the case questions provided, to enhance analytical skills and legal reasoning.

- **Recognizing Key Legal Formalities:** Identify essential formalities for the execution and enforcement of legal documents, understanding their implications on rights and obligations.

- **Analyzing Judicial Precedents and Statutes:** Familiarize yourself with notable judicial interpretations and statutory modifications relevant to obligations and contracts, sales and leases, and secured transactions within the scope of the exam.

Entering the testing center, remember these cornerstones of Civil Code III, reinforcing your ability to navigate through complex legal scenarios with confidence and precision.

## Case Questions
Sample cases offer practical applications of these principles, showcasing potential challenges and resolutions within legal scenarios framed by the Louisiana Civil Code and related statutes.


### Case 1: Commercial Property and Mortgage Agreements
Lou navigates complex legal terrain with Tim, Dan, and the impacts of external judicial actions on his commercial property in Jefferson Parish.

**Relevant Articles:**
- For mortgage execution and enforceability: CC Art. 3275 (Mortgages must be made by authentic act or act under private signature), CC Art. 3338 (Recordation of mortgages).
- For prescription of actions on promissory notes: CC Art. 3499 (Ten-year prescription for personal actions).


**Background**
> Lou owns a commercial property in Jefferson Parish. On February 1, 2013, he entered into a fifteen-year written lease with Tim, which included an option for Tim to purchase the property at any point during the lease for $200,000. The lease specified that Tim was not responsible for property maintenance.

> Seeking funds for property maintenance, Lou secured a loan from Dan in March 2013, guaranteeing repayment with a mortgage on the property, allowing for a secured limit up to $50,000,000. The mortgage, though recorded, was not signed before a notary or witnesses and lacked Dan's signature.

> Tim complained about a leaking roof in 2015, prompting Lou to borrow $20,000 from Dan, neglecting the roof and spending the loan on vacation instead. Lou attempted roof repairs himself in late 2015 and once more in early January 2023.

> Dan, upon rediscovering the unpaid promissory note in January 2023, demanded repayment from Lou, who defaulted, leading Dan to accelerate the loan's maturity.

> In early March 2023, Tim exercised his purchase option. Lou disclosed recent roof repairs and finalized the sale "as-is," with Tim waiving any right to sue over the property's condition. Subsequent roof leaks led Tim to consider rescinding the sale, only to discover the existing mortgage and a judicial judgment against Lou.

**Questions**

**1.1** Was the Act of Mortgage executed by Lou in favor of Dan valid at the time of its execution in March 2013? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question delves into the formal requirements for a valid mortgage agreement, including notarization, witness signatures, and the implications of recording such an agreement without these elements.

**Answer**
The Act of Mortgage by Lou in favor of Dan was not valid at the time of execution due to the absence of notarization, witness signatures, and Dan's signature. Louisiana law requires these formalities for a mortgage to be enforceable against third parties. Despite its recording, the lack of these crucial elements fails to meet the legislative requirements for a valid mortgage.

---

**1.2** At the time the note was signed on May 12, 2015, did the Act of Mortgage secure the promissory note? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This explores how the previously executed (but formally deficient) mortgage impacts its ability to secure a loan made after its recording.

**Answer**
Despite the deficiencies in its execution, the Act of Mortgage could be argued to secure the promissory note due to its recording and the specific language anticipating future indebtedness up to the specified limit. However, the enforceability of this security against third parties or in light of the procedural flaws remains questionable under Louisiana law.

---

**1.3** Had any portion of the note prescribed as of the date the maturity of the note was accelerated (February 10, 2023); and if so, why, and what portion and when? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question examines the concept of prescription (statute of limitations) in relation to debt repayment under Louisiana civil law and the impact of loan acceleration.

**Answer**
Given the acceleration clause was exercised in February 2023 and considering Louisiana's statute of limitations on debt collection, no portion of the note would have prescribed by the time of loan acceleration since Dan acted within ten years of the note's issuance. The entire debt amount remains due and collectable, subject to the specific terms of acceleration and any relevant state laws regarding debt collection practices.

---

**1.4** Was the mortgage granted by Lou in favor of Dan on the Property still effective against third persons as of the date of the sale of the Property to Tim (March 10, 2023); and is it effective against third persons as of the date of this examination (in July 2023)? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Considers the effectiveness and enforceability of a mortgage against third parties, especially after property sale, in the context of Louisiana civil law.

**Answer**
The effectiveness of the mortgage against third parties hinges on its proper recording and whether those parties had notice of its existence. Although initially improperly executed, its prior recording could potentially preserve its enforceability against Tim as of the sale date, provided there were no actions that invalidated Dan's rights. However, the legality of enforcing this mortgage against Tim or future holders as of July 2023 would likely require examination of subsequent legal or transactional events post-sale.

---

**1.5** As of the date of this exam (in July 2023), does Fast Loan, Inc. have an enforceable judicial mortgage on the Property? Explain what steps it should have taken in the past, or should take in the future, to ensure that its judicial mortgage remains enforceable. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question addresses the survival and enforcement of a judicial mortgage post-property sale, plus necessary steps for preservation of such mortgages under Louisiana law.

**Answer**
Fast Loan, Inc.'s judicial mortgage, recorded post-judgment in 2013, remains enforceable against the property, assuming no prescriptive period lapse or actions extinguishing this right. To maintain enforceability, especially considering the property's sale, Fast Loans should have undertaken renewal filings or legal action before the prescriptive period expired, typically ten years for a judgment in Louisiana. For future preservation, renewal or reaffirmation in accordance with state statutes is essential.

### Case 2: Land Sales and Legal Disputes
Steve navigates the complexities of land sales amid fluctuating property values and legal challenges with prospective buyers Tom, Kim, and Eric.

**Relevant Articles:**
- For rescission of sale due to lesion beyond moiety: CC Art. 2589 (Rescission for lesion), CC Art. 2590 (Lesion beyond moiety).
- For specific performance and damages in purchase agreements: CC Art. 1986 (Obligations of the seller), CC Art. 2449 (Right of first refusal).

**Background**

> Steve owned three, adjacent one-acre tracts of unimproved land, known as Lot 1, Lot 2 and Lot 3. Steve was approached by Tom to purchase Lot 1. Steve agreed and sold Lot 1 to Tom for a cash price of $5,000 pursuant to a written Act of Sale on March 1, 2022. The day after the Act of Sale was signed by Steve and Tom, it was recorded in the conveyance records. In December 2022, Steve sold Lot 2 to Kim. Steve thought the value of the land had increased since the sale of Lot 1 and demanded that Kim pay $10,000. As Steve thought the property might increase in value in the future, he added a provision to the Act of Sale providing that Kim may not sell Lot 2 without first offering it to Steve for $10,000, or if less, the price that a third person would be willing to pay.

> On January 20, 2023, Steve and Eric signed a purchase agreement under which Steve agreed to sell Lot 3 to Eric for $10,000, to be paid in cash at closing, which was to occur 90 days after the purchase agreement was signed. At the time the purchase agreement was signed, Eric delivered to Steve a cash payment in the amount of $1,000, which the purchase agreement stipulated to be earnest money.

> On April 3, 2023, a subdivision developer announced plans to build a high-end subdivision on land adjoining Lots 1, 2, and 3. These plans immediately caused the value of all surrounding acreage to rise to approximately $10,000 per acre as they might be able to be placed in the subdivision. Prior to the announcement of those plans, no land in the area had ever sold for more than $10,000 per acre, and $5,000 per acre seemed to be the “going price” for unimproved land in the area during the last five years. Neither Steve nor Tom nor Kim nor Eric knew about the plans of the subdivision before this announcement.

> In view of the developer’s plans and a possible rise in property values, Steve notified Tom on April 10, 2023, that Tom’s purchase of Lot 1 is “void” because the price Tom paid for Lot 1 was “unconscionably low.” Steve also notified Kim that he (Steve) was exercising his option to repurchase Lot 2 and demanded that Kim sell Lot 2 back to him at the $10,000 price for which Kim had purchased Lot 2. Kim advised Steve that she would not sell Lot 2 to him as she was keeping it and wanted to build her own house on it. Steve also notified Eric that he (Steve) does not wish to proceed with the sale of Lot 3 to Eric.

**Questions**

**2.1** What action might Steve reasonably file to seek rescission of the sale of Lot 1 to Tom? If that action is filed as of the date of this examination (in July 2023), is it timely? (3 points) Assuming that the action is timely, is Steve likely to prevail? Explain. (3 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
This question seeks to unravel Steve's legal standing to rescind a finalized sale based on claims of an unconscionably low sale price, assessing the timeliness and strength of such legal action within Louisiana property law.

**Answer**
Steve might seek to file an action for rescission based on lesion beyond moiety, arguing that the sale price was significantly below the property's true value. However, such actions must be filed within a year of the sale's execution for immovable property. Given that Steve sought rescission in July 2023 for a sale made in March 2022, his action would not be timely. Moreover, proving unconscionable undervaluation requires demonstrating that the sale price was less than half of the property's market value at the time of sale. Since the sale to Tom was made before the surge in property values due to the subdivision announcement, Steve is unlikely to prevail.

**2.2** What defense does Kim have to Steve’s action for exercising his right to buy back Lot 2? Explain. (6 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Analyzes Kim's legal defenses against Steve's attempt to enforce a repurchase option in the wake of increased land values and whether the terms of their sale agreement uphold such a right under evolving market conditions.

**Answer**
Kim's primary defense would center on the specific terms of their initial sale agreement and the absence of subsequent mutual consent to modify these terms. She can argue that the repurchase provision was conditional, predicated on her desire to sell, which she now does not possess. Furthermore, the significant change in property values and lack of agreement on adjusting the repurchase price in response to market changes weaken Steve's position. Thus, Kim's defense would likely stand, especially if she demonstrates reliance upon the original sale's permanence in her decision-making and property investments.

**2.3** If Eric sues Steve for specific performance under the purchase agreement to force the sale of Lot 3 and for damages, is Eric likely to succeed? Explain. (6 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Evaluates Eric's prospects in compelling Steve to fulfill the sale agreement under specific performance and damages doctrine, considering the binding nature of their contract before the unexpected rise in property values.

**Answer**
Given that Eric and Steve entered into a legally binding purchase agreement with defined terms, including a set price and a specific performance clause, Eric's lawsuit for specific performance stands on firm legal ground. The fact that Steve sought to cancel the agreement unilaterally due to external market factors does not invalidate the binding commitment made under the agreed contract terms. Unless Steve can demonstrate a substantial legal or equitable ground for contract termination, Eric is likely to succeed in both compelling the completion of the sale and potentially securing damages for any losses incurred due to Steve's attempted rescission.

**2.4** Does either Steve or Eric have the right to recede from the purchase agreement of Lot 3? For each party, explain why or why not and what amount, if any, such party must pay to recede. (6 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Delves into contract law principles to determine the conditions under which either party might withdraw from the purchase agreement without breaching contractual obligations, highlighting any applicable restitution or penalty.

**Answer**
Under Louisiana law, once a purchase agreement is executed and consideration is exchanged (as evidenced by Eric's earnest money payment), neither party has an inherent right to unilaterally rescind the agreement without cause. Steve's change of mind due to increased property values does not constitute a valid cause for rescission. Eric's actions do not indicate any desire or legal grounds to recede from the agreement. Should a party unlawfully rescind the agreement, they could be liable for damages, including the return of any earnest money paid and potentially additional damages incurred by the other party due to the breached agreement. Thus, absent mutual consent to terminate the agreement or fulfill specific contract clauses allowing for termination, neither party has the unilateral right to recede without facing potential legal consequences.



### Case 3: Property Leasing and Financial Disputes
Lisa deals with the repercussions of failed business ventures, legal entanglements with creditors, and disputes over lease agreements.

**Relevant Articles:**
- For validity of mortgages and obligations: CC Art. 3287 (Requirements for a valid mortgage), CC Art. 3352 (Prescription of mortgages).
- For lease agreements and modifications: CC Art. 2673 (Lease agreement formation), CC Art. 2713 (Modification of lease terms).


**Background**
> In October 2012, Lisa decided her town in Iberville Parish needed a pet store. Lisa then approached Big Bank for a loan to begin her business. Big Bank agreed to give Lisa a $50,000 loan but required collateral, so Lisa agreed to place a mortgage on her Iberville Parish residence. This residence already had a mortgage on it granted in favor of Credit Inc. to secure a loan dated February 1, 2010, with a maturity date of January 1, 2025, properly described and recorded in the mortgage records of Iberville Parish on February 1, 2010.

> Big Bank agreed to accept a second mortgage on the Iberville residence. On October 15, 2012, Lisa signed a promissory note in favor of Big Bank in the amount of $50,000 payable in 72 monthly installments starting November 1, 2012, and continuing until October 1, 2018, and also signed an Act of Mortgage to secure the promissory note. The mortgage contained a proper legal description of the Iberville residence, referenced the promissory note and its principal amount and date of signature, specified its installment dates and maturity date, and was signed by Lisa and two witnesses, but not by Big Bank. The notary recorded the mortgage in the mortgage records of Iberville Parish on October 16, 2012.

> Lisa purchased her store supplies from Pet Supply Inc. Business was great until a larger pet store opened nearby. With fewer customers, Lisa was unable to pay all of her bills. On December 1, 2017, Lisa made her monthly installment payment to Big Bank (as she had done every prior month), but made no further payments to Big Bank after 2017. Lisa did not pay her supplier and was sued by Pet Supply Inc., which obtained a money judgment against Lisa on January 15, 2018, and recorded the judgment the same day in the mortgage records of Iberville Parish.

> None of the creditors has sought to reinscribe its mortgage.

> In January 2021, Lisa decided to start a new business. She asked her friend, Dan, who owned a shopping center, to lease her space with a one-year term. Dan wanted her to sign a written lease with a five-year term. Knowing her former business failed, he required a co-signer on the lease. Lisa agreed and stated she could have her mother co-sign the lease. Dan was satisfied with that proposal and stated he would prepare a written lease.

> Lisa received the written lease from Dan. The lease contained an acceleration of rent clause. Not wanting to commit to a five-year lease, especially with the acceleration clause, Lisa marked up the lease document with a pen, reducing the term to one year commencing February 1, 2021, then signed the marked-up lease and mailed it back to Dan without pointing out her change to the lease term. Dan received the lease that Lisa signed and noticed that Lisa’s mother had not signed the lease as a guarantor. Dan called Lisa’s mother, who stated during the phone call that she was sure Lisa could pay the rent but promised to make sure the rent was paid if Lisa failed to do so. Neither Lisa’s mother nor Dan ever signed the lease. Dan allowed Lisa to move into the leased space and start operating her business.

> Lisa’s business failed again. She mailed her August 1, 2022, rent payment to Dan with a letter stating she had decided to close the store and would vacate the premises at the end of August 2022. Dan received the letter on August 15, 2022. Dan called Lisa and advised her that he intended to sue her and her mother for any future rent owed and not paid under the terms of the lease.

**Questions**

**3.1** Is Big Bank’s mortgage valid, and does it secure the $50,000 promissory note that Lisa executed in favor of Big Bank? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Consider the elements that constitute a valid mortgage under Louisiana law, such as proper execution, notarization, and recording. Reflect on how these requirements assure public notice and protect creditors' interests. Assess how the absence of these elements might affect the mortgage's enforceability against the property and third parties.

**Answer**
The Big Bank’s mortgage, despite not being witnessed, signed by Big Bank, or notarized, might still be considered valid based on its recording. However, its enforceability, particularly regarding the $50,000 promissory note signed after the mortgage’s execution, may be compromised. Under Louisiana law, failure to adhere to formal requirements might not invalidate the mortgage, but could affect its rank and prioritization against other claims on the property.

**3.2** As of the date of this exam, have any of the installments due on the Big Bank note prescribed and therefore are now uncollectable? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Explore the concept of prescription, specifically how it applies to the enforceability of debt obligations over time. Understand the statutory periods after which unexercised rights might no longer be actionable and how these periods aim to balance the interests of creditors and debtors. Consider the timeline of events in relation to these statutory periods to evaluate the collectability of debts.

**Answer**
Given that Lisa ceased payments in 2017 and legal action or demand for payment was not noted until 2023, portions of the debt may have prescribed. Louisiana law prescribes a ten-year period for promissory notes, making early missed installments potentially uncollectable, depending on the timing of the bank's foreclosure actions and demands for payment.


**3.3** As of the date of this exam, is Pet Supply’s judicial mortgage superior in rank to Credit Inc.’s and Big Bank’s mortgages? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Examine the hierarchy of creditors and how mortgages and judicial liens are prioritized and enforced against a property. Look into the principle of "first in time, first in right" and its exceptions, and how recording dates might influence the rank and rights of subsequent creditors and purchasers.


**Answer**
Pet Supply Inc.’s judicial mortgage’s rank depends on its recording date relative to other encumbrances. Generally, mortgages rank according to the date of recording. Since Pet Supply's judgment was recorded after Big Bank’s mortgage but before potential reinscriptions or subsequent actions, its priority would be secondary to Big Bank's mortgage, considering enforceability against Credit Inc.'s earlier recorded mortgage.

**3.4** What must Pet Supply Inc. do to maintain the validity and effectiveness against third persons of its money judgment, and by what date must these steps be taken? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Review the procedures for maintaining the effectiveness of a judicial mortgage against third parties. This will involve understanding the concept of reinscription and its purpose in keeping judgments active within the public record. Consider the required timing and legal paperwork that ensure ongoing enforceability.

**Answer**
To maintain its judicial mortgage's validity, Pet Supply Inc. must reinscribe the judgment within ten years of its original recording date, by January 15, 2028. Failure to reinscribe within this period would risk the judgment becoming unenforceable against third parties and the property.


**3.5** Will Lisa be able to escape liability under the lease on the ground that there was no meeting of the minds over the terms of the lease? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Delve into the legal theory of "meeting of the minds" in contract formation, focusing on how mutual consent and agreement on all essential terms are crucial for a valid contract. Reflect on how modifications and communicated intentions affect this mutual understanding, especially when changes are not explicitly agreed upon by both parties.

**Answer**
Lisa’s attempted termination, communicated through a letter without fulfilling the full originally disputed term, may not conform with termination provisions typically outlined in commercial lease agreements. Without a clause allowing early termination under the conditions Lisa acted upon, her termination may be deemed improper, potentially exposing her to liability for the remaining rent under the original terms.


**3.6** Did Lisa properly terminate the lease? Explain. (10 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Analyze the legal and contractual mechanisms by which a lease can be terminated, comparing these to the actions taken by the lessee. Consider the importance of adhering to agreed procedures for termination and how deviations from these procedures can impact the legal outcome.

**Answer**
Lisa’s attempted termination, communicated through a letter without fulfilling the full originally disputed term, may not conform with termination provisions typically outlined in commercial lease agreements. Without a clause allowing early termination under the conditions Lisa acted upon, her termination may be deemed improper, potentially exposing her to liability for the remaining rent under the original terms.


**3.7** For purposes of this Question 1.7 only, assume that Lisa still owes Dan $1,000 in unpaid rent under the lease. Does Dan have recourse against Lisa’s mother for this unpaid rent? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Consider the legal status and obligations of a guarantor in lease agreements. Focus on the difference between informal assurances and legally binding guarantees, assessing how the formality and documentation of an agreement contribute to its enforceability against third parties, including guarantors.

**Answer**
Dan's recourse against Lisa’s mother would hinge on the existence and enforceability of a guaranty. Given the lack of a written, signed agreement from Lisa's mother and her casual assurance over the phone, enforcing such a claim poses challenges. Verbal guarantees for lease obligations require clear, incontrovertible evidence of intent to be bound, which may not be sufficiently demonstrated in this scenario, potentially limiting Dan’s ability to legally compel payment from Lisa’s mother.

### Case 4: Shopping Center Lease and Sale Dispute
Les Lester and Super Store confront challenges stemming from a property sale, lease agreements, and the right of first refusal disputes.

**Relevant Articles:**
- For the notice of lease and its sufficiency under the public records doctrine: CC Art. 3338 (Registry of leases), CC Art. 3342 (Effects of recording).
- For right of first refusal and its enforcement: CC Art. 2625 (Right of first refusal in sale of immovable property).


**Background**
> Lester Place LLC owns Lester Shopping Center in Acadia Parish, Louisiana. Lester Place entered into a lease of a portion of the shopping center to Super Store Inc., which operates a grocery store on the leased premises. The lease, which was dated January 2000, had a term of twenty years, with a rent of $10,000 per month. The lease contained no provisions regarding the maintenance of the leased property but required public parking areas to be kept "reasonably free of unreturned shopping baskets." Lester Place prepared a notice of lease which listed the names of the lessor and lessee and the expiration date of the term of the lease but nothing further. Lester Place and Super Store signed the notice of lease, and Lester Place promptly recorded it in the mortgage records of Acadia Parish, but not the conveyance records.

> Les Lester, the sole member and manager of Lester Place, was a close personal friend of Steve Smith, the owner of Super Store. In late 2003, Steve expressed to Les an interest in buying the shopping center. Lester Place agreed to grant Steve a right of first refusal to purchase the property, and on December 26, 2003, executed a document containing the following provisions:

> >  LESTER PLACE LLC ("LESTER") HEREBY GRANTS TO STEVE SMITH ("STEVE") FOR A TERM ENDING ON DECEMBER 26, 2023, A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO PURCHASE LESTER SHOPPING CENTER, LOCATED ON LOT A OF GREEN ACRES SUBDIVISION, ACADIA PARISH. IN ORDER TO EXERCISE THIS RIGHT, STEVE MUST NOTIFY LESTER OF HIS ACCEPTANCE OF LESTER'S OFFER TO SELL WITHIN TEN DAYS OF STEVE'S RECEIPT OF WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE TERMS UNDER WHICH LESTER IS WILLING TO SELL THE PROPERTY TO A BONA FIDE PURCHASER.

> Les delivered the document to Steve, who kept it in his office at the grocery store until December, 2010. Steve, knowing that Les was growing old, realized that he probably needed to record the document in order to protect his rights. Steve recorded the document in the conveyance records of Acadia Parish in December of 2010.

> In May of 2014, Lester Place sold the Lester Shopping Center property to Rob Robertson. The act of sale stated that Rob was subrogated to all rights of Lester Place against all prior owners but did not contain any agreement by Rob to assume any existing leases. Nevertheless, Rob reviewed all of the leases of the property before buying it, including the lease with Super Store. Before the closing, Rob sent Les a letter, telling him that Rob "would take good care of everything and everyone, as we discussed." When Super Store mailed its rent check on June 1, 2014, Rob returned it with a letter notifying Super Store that he was evicting Super Store due to Super Store's failure to maintain the roof, which had small leaks, and due to Super Store's failure to cause its shopping carts to be returned to the store during the Memorial Day weekend of 2014, resulting in a loss of parking spaces for other tenants. He also notified Super Store that its lease was not recorded and that he had no intention of honoring it. The next day, Rob filed an eviction proceeding against Super Store. Super Store filed a separate suit against Lester Place for damages arising out of Rob's eviction proceeding. Steve filed his own suit against Lester Place demanding damages for its breach of the right of first refusal.

> A clothing store, Bedazzled, also leased property in the Lester Shopping Center for a ten-year term ending in 2020. At the time of the sale to Rob in May of 2014, Bedazzled had two outstanding, unpaid monthly rental payments and had removed its merchandise from the shopping center to a new store across the street. Bedazzled's lease from Lester Place granted the lessor the right to accelerate rent following the lessee's default. Rob noticed that Bedazzled's merchandise was moved across the street and that Bedazzled had put up a sign on the leased premises stating, "Closed, moved to new location." Because Bedazzled had abandoned its lease space, Rob filed a lawsuit to evict Bedazzled and obtain a judgment of eviction. Rob could not locate a tenant to rent the same space, so Rob filed a lawsuit against Bedazzled for the past due rent as well as all future rent owed under the lease.


**4.1** Was the recorded notice of the lease between Lester Place and Super Store sufficient
under the public records doctrine to make the lease effective against third persons?
Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Analyze the legal sufficiency of a recorded lease notice under public records doctrine to ensure lease enforceability against third parties. Consider how recording specifics contribute to establishing priority rights and obligations under commercial leases.

**Answer**
The recorded notice of lease, listing only the names of the lessor and lessee and the lease's expiration date, while minimal, generally suffices to notify third parties of the lease's existence and its duration under the public records doctrine. The effectiveness against third parties would primarily depend on the notice's ability to alert interested parties to inquire further for full lease terms, thus affecting the lease's enforceability against such third parties in Louisiana.

**4.2** Assume solely for this Question 4.2 that the notice of lease between Lester Place and Super Store was NOT sufficient under the public records doctrine to make the lease effective against third persons. In defense of the suit filed by Super Store, Rob claims to be a third-party purchaser entitled to the protection under the public records doctrine. What arguments could be raised against him to defeat his claim of protection from the public records doctrine? Explain. (10 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Explore the protections offered by the public records doctrine to third-party purchasers and identify potential arguments that could challenge these protections, especially in the context of undisclosed or unrecorded lease terms.


**Answer**
Rob, as a third-party purchaser, could claim protection under the public records doctrine, arguing he relied on recorded documents before the purchase. Against him, it might be argued that his pre-purchase review of all leases, including the actual lease terms with Super Store and his acknowledgment of responsibilities in his communication with Les Lester, indicate implicit acceptance of the lease's terms, overriding his claim of insufficient notice as per public records.


**4.3** Assume solely for this Question 2.3 that the notice of lease between Lester Place and Super Store WAS sufficient under the public records doctrine to make the lease effective against third persons, including Rob. What defenses should Super Store assert against Rob in the eviction action? Explain. (10 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Examine the defenses available to a tenant under a well-documented lease when facing eviction from a new property owner unfamiliar with the original lease terms. Investigate how sufficient public notice of lease terms impacts these defenses.


**Answer**
Super Store should assert that the lease was sufficiently detailed in the public record to inform third-party purchasers of its existence and terms, making the lease enforceable against Rob. Furthermore, evidence of Rob's pre-purchase knowledge and subsequent actions implying acceptance of the lease obligations would strengthen Super Store's defense against eviction.

**4.4** Assume that the court grants Rob a judgment of eviction against Super Store. Is Super Store likely to prevail in its suit against Lester Place? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Consider the bases on which an evicted tenant can seek damages from the original lessor, focusing on the continuity of lease obligations despite property ownership changes and the implications of rights conferred or obligations assumed by the new owner.


**Answer**
Super Store is likely to prevail against Lester Place if it can demonstrate that Rob's actions, ostensibly on Lester Place's behalf, including the unilateral eviction attempt and violation of lease terms known to Rob pre-purchase, were wrongful and breached the lease agreement. Additionally, Lester Place's failure to ensure Rob’s compliance with existing lease obligations could be seen as a breach of the lessor’s duty to Super Store.

**4.5** What grounds should Steve assert in his action against Lester Place for damages for the breach of the right of first refusal, what defenses are available to Lester Place, and is Steve likely to prevail in his suit against Lester Place? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Delve into the legal requirements for enforcing a right of first refusal, particularly how such rights are affected by property sales and whether the proper procedural steps were followed to preserve these rights against new property owners.


**Answer**
Steve should argue that the right of first refusal was a binding contractual agreement breached by Lester Place’s sale to Rob without offering Steve the opportunity to purchase under the agreed terms. Lester Place might defend against this by contesting the sufficiency of the agreement’s recordation or Steve’s failure to act within the stipulated time frame upon notice of sale. The original document’s recording in the conveyance records would generally support Steve’s position, potentially leading to his prevailing in the suit if the court finds the right of first refusal was effectively communicated and enforceable.



**4.6** What grounds should Rob assert in his action against Bedazzled for the past due rent as well as the rent due for the remaining term of Bedazzled’s lease; what defenses should Bedazzled assert; and who is likely to prevail? Explain. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Assess the legal standing of a lessee vs. lessor conflict arising from lease abandonment, unpaid rent, and future rent obligations. Understand the criteria for determining lease abandonment and the rights of parties involved in determining lease obligation fulfillment and enforcement.


**Answer**
Rob’s lawsuit against Bedazzled should assert abandonment and breach of lease for unpaid rent and vacating the premises without proper termination. Bedazzled might argue constructive eviction or breach of lease terms by Rob necessitating their move. Given Rob's timely action against Bedazzled’s default and absence, coupled with lease terms allowing for acceleration of rent and Bedazzled's clear abandonment, Rob is likely to prevail for past due and future rent under the lease terms.


### Case 5: Guarantees and Mortgages on LLC Business Loans
Sierra and Howard's Bayou, LLC faces complications with business loans, personal guarantees, and the sale of collateral property.

**Relevant Articles:**
- For suretyship and guaranty: CC Art. 3035 (Suretyship agreement requirements), CC Art. 3047-3052 (Rights and obligations of sureties).
- For prescription of notes and mortgages: CC Art. 3434 (Prescription of actions on promissory notes), CC Art. 3458 (Reinscription of mortgages).

**Background**
> Sierra and Howard, who are not related, are the sole members of Bayou, LLC ("Bayou"). In June of 2014, Bayou borrowed the sum of $50,000 from Leslie. The loan was evidenced by a written promissory note executed by Howard on behalf of Bayou in the amount of $50,000 dated June 5, 2014 ("Note A") payable to the order of Leslie, with interest payable monthly on the first of each month beginning July 1, 2014, and with a final balloon payment of all outstanding principal and unpaid interest due on January 5, 2022.

> At the time of execution of Note A, Howard executed a written guaranty in favor of Leslie by which Howard personally guaranteed all present and future indebtedness of Bayou to Leslie. This guaranty has not been released nor revoked. At the same time, in order to secure Note A, Howard executed and delivered to Leslie a written mortgage, in which Howard granted a mortgage "over all of my property in Caddo Parish, Louisiana", with no further description; the mortgage provides that $50,000 is the maximum amount of the obligations secured by the mortgage. The mortgage was not signed by Leslie, nor was it witnessed or notarized. This mortgage (the "2014 Mortgage") was promptly duly recorded in the mortgage records of Caddo Parish, where Howard owned several properties.

> In July 2014, after this loan was made, Sierra called Leslie and left a voice mail message on Leslie's office phone assuring Leslie that Note A would be paid and that Sierra personally guaranteed payment of Note A.

> In June of 2018, Bayou obtained an additional loan from Leslie. The loan was in the amount of $100,000, was evidenced by a written promissory note in the amount of $100,000 dated June 3, 2018 ("Note B") by Bayou, payable on demand to the order of Leslie.

> In January 2021, Leslie and Bayou (acting through Sierra) entered into a note modification agreement, in which Note B was converted from a demand note to a note payable in full on January 1, 2022, at an increased interest rate. Howard was not aware of this modification at the time it was made.

> The execution of both Note A and Note B, the borrowing of funds thereunder, and the execution of the note modification agreement were all duly and properly authorized by the members of Bayou.

> In January of 2022, Leslie demanded payment in full of Notes A and B from Bayou and Howard.

> On February 1, 2022, Howard sold all of his Caddo Parish properties to a third-party purchaser for cash in a properly recorded written act of sale signed by Howard. The 2014 Mortgage was not mentioned in the act of sale.

> As of today, no payments have been made on Note A or Note B.


**Questions**

**5.1** Is the 2014 Mortgage invalid because it was not signed by Leslie and lacked witnesses
and notarization? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Investigate the validity of a mortgage lacking conventional formalities such as witness signatures, notarization, and mortgagor’s endorsement, particularly focusing on Louisiana law's requirements for a mortgage's enforceability against the mortgaged property and third parties.

**Answer**
The 2014 Mortgage, despite lacking Leslie’s signature, witnesses, and notarization, could still be seen as valid due to its recording, signaling the intent to secure Leslie’s loan to Bayou, LLC. However, its enforceability against Howard’s property, particularly in Caddo Parish, might hinge on specific local requirements for mortgage formalities, potentially limiting its effectiveness without conventional validation.

**5.2** Is the 2014 Mortgage effective against the third-party purchaser who purchased
Howard’s Caddo Parish properties in 2022? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Assess the enforceability of an improperly executed mortgage against subsequent purchasers of the mortgaged property. Consider principles of bona fide purchasers and the impact of mortgage recording absent traditional validation steps on subsequent transactions.

**Answer**
The enforceability of the 2014 Mortgage against third-party purchasers generally relies on the doctrine of bona fide purchasers and the notice provided by the mortgage's recording. Given the mortgage's recording prior to Howard’s sale of properties, and the deficiencies in its execution, the mortgage's effectiveness against a bona fide purchaser without actual knowledge of the unresolved debt may be compromised, potentially leaving Leslie without recourse against the sold properties.


**5.3** Did Sierra’s voice mail message left for Leslie in July of 2014 create an effective
suretyship of Note A? Explain fully. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Review the role of oral or informal communications (e.g., voicemail messages) in establishing a legally binding suretyship, especially when the guarantor has not signed a formal guaranty document. Consider the legal elements necessary for creating an enforceable personal guarantee.


**Answer**
Sierra’s voicemail, while indicating an intention to guarantee Bayou, LLC’s indebtedness under Note A, lacks the formal requirements for a binding guarantee, such as a written, signed document. Louisiana law requiring written acknowledgment for a guarantee to be enforceable against the guarantor would likely render Sierra’s informal assurance ineffective as a legal suretyship.

**5.4** Has any portion of the principal or interest due under Note A prescribed? Explain
fully. (10 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Explore the statute of limitations for the enforcement of promissory notes and mortgages in Louisiana. Examine how prescription might impact the collectability of principal and interest payments long after their due dates, specifically in light of any actions (or inactions) taken by the creditor.

**Answer**
Given that Note A's final balloon payment was due in January 2022 and that Howard made no payments since early on, portions of the note may be at risk of prescription. However, if the note or related obligations were addressed or acknowledged in any form by Bayou, LLC or Howard within the ten-year prescriptive period for promissory notes in Louisiana, the debt would remain actionable. The lack of any payment or action until Leslie's demand in January 2022 could thus leave Leslie within rights to seek full recovery.



**5.5** List and fully explain the three forms of suretyship. (5 points)

**Tips & Analysis**
Examine the different forms of suretyship recognized under Louisiana law, understanding key differences, obligations, and rights of sureties, principals, and obligees within each form. Highlight statutory requirements and common defenses in suretyship relationships.

**Answer**
The three forms of suretyship recognized under Louisiana law include:
    - Legal Suretyship - Arising by operation of law, such as in certain familial or matrimonial debts.
    - Conventional Suretyship - An agreement where one party agrees to be liable for another's debt, usually requiring express consent and formal documentation.
    - Commercial Suretyship - Often found in business contexts, where businesses or corporations act as sureties in commercial transactions, subjected to specific commercial codes and practices.
In each form, the surety’s obligation is to guarantee the debt of another, with variations relating to formation, enforcement, and discharge conditions.

**5.6** Has Leslie’s right to recovery from Howard of the balance due under Note B been
impaired by any subsequent actions of Leslie? Explain fully. (10 points)


**Tips & Analysis**
Evaluate the circumstances under which the modification of a business loan or actions by the creditor post-loan issuance might impact the creditor’s rights to recover from a guarantor. Determine the extent to which subsequent agreements or modifications can impair a creditor's right to full recovery under the original terms of a loan and guarantee.

**Answer**
Leslie’s modification of Note B’s terms without Howard’s knowledge or consent, particularly changing it from a demand note to one with a fixed payment date and adjusting interest rates, could be viewed as materially altering Howard’s obligations as a guarantor, potentially impairing Leslie’s right to recover under Note B. The lack of Howard’s involvement in the modification could render the guarantee for Note B unenforceable if it could be shown that the changes prejudiced Howard’s position or increased his liability without his agreement.
